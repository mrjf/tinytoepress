<p> <b>Foreword</b></p> 
 
<p>What does it take to make a world champion and what does it take to break him? These are the questions that frame this powerful and gripping fictionalized account of the tempestuous career of Antonio Cervantes Reyes who fought under the ring name of Kid Pambelé. At the height of his fame he was the pride of Colombia and hailed as a national hero when he became the first world boxing champion in Colombia’s history by winning the World Boxing Association (WBA) light-welterweight crown from the Panamanian Alfonso “Peppermint” Frazer in 1972. Under the management of Ramiro Machado, the Afro-Colombian kid from San Basilio de Palenque compiled an impressive 91-12-3 record, with 44 of his wins by knockout. The majority of his fights took place in Colombia or Venezuela, so his countrymen got plenty of opportunity to see him in action—something that only enhanced his popularity. Yet he was by no means a stay-at-home fighter: he also took fights in Argentina, Japan, Puerto Rico, South Africa, South Korea, and Thailand. And fans in the United States could have witnessed his ring exploits in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York.</p> 
<p>In <i>Heart of Scorpio</i>, Joseph Avski has magically transformed life into art and in so doing cunningly refashioned his protagonist, Milton Olivella, into something more than a champion fighter. The quotidian struggles of this distinctly flawed hero are at the heart of this multi-voiced novella. Though he has thrilled the crowds with his courage and his boxing skills in the ring, outside the ring the vicissitudes of fortune loom large. Thus while Olivella’s pugilistic triumphs are duly celebrated, they are overshadowed by his chaotic domestic life. He abuses his long-suffering wife, Ángela; he fails his only son, Julián, and drags them both down with him into his increasingly dysfunctional world. Meanwhile, for Olivella, fleeting memories of his glory days help blunt painful reality. Not surprisingly, drugs are the precipitating cause of most of his problems and he even sells his wedding ring to buy drugs. Readers are clearly invited to see the boxer as a kind of everyman, even as the embodiment of Colombia—a proud nation-state that has struggled so long with “la violencia” and with a corrosive drug ‘culture.’ This identification is rendered more pointed by the political friendship between World Champion Olivella and the real-life President of Colombia, Andrés Pastrana who was himself once kidnapped by the Medellin drug cartel, and whose father had been President while Olivella / Pambelé had been champion.</p> 
<p>The clever interweaving of fact and fiction will be evident to those who have followed Kid Pambelé’s remarkable career—he was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998 and honored as his nation’s Fighter of the Century by the Colombian Boxing Federation in 2000. For boxing aficionados, then, reference to Milton Olivella’s losing title bid against “the Argentine Marturet” in Luna Park in 1971, will conjure up Kid Palembé’s heart-rending points loss to the elusive champion Nicolino Locche—he was dubbed “intocable” (untouchable) for his defensive skills—in Buenos Aires in that very location. And the date on which Olivella actually wins his title (October 28, 1972) corresponds to the date of Kid Pambelé’s sensational knockout win over reigning champion Alfonso “Peppermint” Frazer. </p> 
<p>Offering a fictional account of a real champion boxer’s life-story is not, of course, without precedent. Budd Schulberg’s <i>The Harder They Fall</i> (1947) used the career of the Italian heavyweight Primo Carnera, aka “The Ambling Alp,” as the basis for his novel about El Toro Molina, the gentle giant from the Andes who is taken advantage of by all those around him; and Howard Sackler’s <i>The Great White Hope</i> (1968) dramatized the tumultuous times of Jack Johnson, the first black world heavyweight champion, who was thinly disguised as Jack Jefferson in the play. To be sure, <i>The Heart of Scorpio</i> is not the story of a <i>heavyweight</i> champion, but it is a powerfully told story that carries a knockout punch.</p>

<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Translator’s Introduction</h4> 
<p>This introduction to <i>Heart of Scorpio</i> serves two purposes: an orientation to the Republic of Colombia where I occasionally worked and traveled during my career as a US Marine Corps officer and an explanation of the genesis of this translation. Colombia, a country with a rich and complicated history, is nearly twice the size of Texas and is broken into swaths of Amazon jungle, grassy plains, and Atlantic and Pacific coasts by three Andean ridges with peaks just shy of 19,000 feet in elevation. Colombia governs from Bogotá, a city of over eight million people at over 8,600 feet above sea level. A country of paradoxes, Colombia is home to opulent wealth and heartbreaking poverty, natural beauty and decades-long armed conflict, attractive and hospitable people and an astronomical level of kidnapping and violence. </p> 
<p>The novel takes place mostly in the Colombian cities of Cartagena and Palenque on the Caribbean coast. Cartagena, a walled Spanish colonial city founded in the 16th century, was a key port for shipping extracted riches to the mother country and also served as a principal point of slave trading. The village of Palenque, established by runaway slaves in the 1600’s and the birthplace of the novel’s protagonist, is today a bend in the road about an hour south of Cartagena. It is my unscientific observation that the food, the weather, and the ethnic profile of the coastal Colombian are more akin to Caribbean societies than to those of their countrymen in Bogotá or Medellín. To me, Colombians along the coast are more Caribbean in nature than Colombian.</p> 
<p>My opportunity to translate this novel came through very personal circumstances. Joseph Avski arrived to the Ph.D. program in Hispanic Studies at Texas A&amp;M University as my new classmate in the fall of 2009. We made fast friends and I asked to read his new novel. I was impressed by the depth of the characters and ambitious interweaving of narrators and I found that my friend was also a great storyteller. My first impulse to translate the book grew chiefly out of a desire to share it with my English-speaking family and friends. Like Joseph, I grew up at a cultural crossroads. Mine was that of Cajun and redneck, Catholic and Protestant, black and white small-town Louisiana. In the Spanish-speaking voices of Joseph’s characters I heard the same rhythm and musicality as the English-speaking voices I heard growing up, which didn’t surprise me when I realized that Cartagena is closer to New Orleans than New Orleans is to Los Angeles, California. </p> 
<p>This translation was a joint project. More than once Joseph and I, the Colombian and North American sons of European immigrants, would distill a phrase or a sentence down to just the right word in English that would convey not only the meaning but the feel of the Spanish text. It was a process of shared discovery that would reach a word sometimes Latin-based and sometimes Germanic in origin. We would share a look and I could not help but wonder if a linguistic and metaphysical circle opened by ancestors from another epoch was not completed in that moment.</p> 
<p>If you, dear reader, prefer books with fairy-tale endings you would do well to not read this novel. Even in English, the Colombian characters and places will sit very close to you. <i>Heart of Scorpio</i> reveals the best and worst in you and me; both the divine and the despicable parts of ourselves. This story shows all the pathos of the human condition at the height of brilliant success and in the deepest, most disastrous failure and examines the very brittle, delicate wall between these two constructs. </p>

<p>“Want me to tell ya ‘bout it?” said Milton Olivella moving his fists of steel with the weight of fifty-seven hard lived years. He moved a few inches from the table to make space between two chairs and bumped against another table, almost knocking over a beer bottle. “Careful,” said Joseph Avski when he saw the bottle dance on the tabletop. “Don't worry, brotha,” soothed Milton, ”They know me here in this bar. You're with a world champion, anyway, ya know?” It was the first time Avski had laid eyes on him after two years of investigation. Until then Milton had stayed one step ahead. If he went to his house to look for him, Ángela Iguarán, his wife, would tell him that it was too bad but if by the grace of God he had arrived five minutes earlier he would have caught him at home. If he dropped by his friend Johnny Pitalúa's gym, Johnny would tell him that Milton had just gone out to buy some new gloves for a fighter, a kid, man, who's gonna be a world champ, like Milton. If he went to Bazurto's market in Cartagena some would assure him Olivella had just left and others would swear he hadn’t been in there in months. It didn't matter where or in what city Avski looked, Milton Olivella was always one step ahead. When he sat down to write the story he remembered finally seeing Olivella standing in front of a table with his hands up, smiling as if he were not really there, but present in a past many years distant. Up until that day Milton Olivella gave the impression that he was everywhere and nowhere, that he existed in other times but never in the present. He appeared and disappeared as if he had mastered some secret of tribal African magic. And he would transform into different personalities of himself: one minute he was the sports car collector who could hold forth about the design advantages of Porsche over Ferrari and the next minute he’d be a maniac threatening a waitress with a butter knife for having confused him with an ex-soccer star from Uni—n Magdalena. One night he was charged with assault and battery in Monter’a, Manizales, Tunja and Armenia; four different cities in Colombia. In all four cases he was proven to be present but declared innocent. When a national news reporter interviewed one of the judges and asked him about the apparent contradiction of the charges against Olivella in four distinct places separated by over six hundred miles at the same time, he responded, “The facts are the facts.” </p> 
<p> One night Avski received a call informing him that Olivella had been admitted to the university hospital with a knife wound in the buttocks, but when he arrived at the hospital Olivella had already left after stealing sheets, bottles of anesthetic and syringes. Avski interviewed one of the nurses and suggested that Olivella might be crazy. “Crazy?” answered the nurse. “I’ve known Olivella for more than twenty years and to tell you the truth, I’m crazier than he is.” </p> 
<p>Years of Avski’s investigation had produced all kinds of stories. One afternoon he appeared nude in a photo that was reproduced by all the tabloids, and the photo turned out to have been photo-shopped. Avski saw all kinds of home videos about Olivella. In one of them he was imitating the chirp of the parakeets in the Ecce Homo barrio in Valledupar; there was another that started showing the bout where he defeated Martinez and finished punching and grabbing at a cameraman; while a third one showed him dancing the champeta in a neighborhood on the outskirts of Cartagena. A man in Cali related that he had heard Olivella imitating Héctor Lavoe around one of the places in town where you can buy drugs. A young man in Cúcuta remembered him recommending sex with animals. An Italian tourist reported that he had argued with Olivella about the quality of French wines. A taxi driver from Barranquilla remembered that he heard Olivella come up with a game-day lineup for the Colombian national soccer team that was a mix of live and dead players as well as a Spanish bullfighter. A student at the University of Antioquia in Medellín heard him accuse the President of the United States of having hatched a plan for Olivella to lose his World Junior Welterweight title. The same day a student at the University of C—rdoba who was on vacation in Santa Marta said they had played beach football and smoked marijuana together afterwards. A lawyer from Pasto swore to Avski that Olivella had invited him to lunch and ended up making a huge scene because the waiter didn’t know the correct etiquette for serving the wine. </p> 
<p> Thousands, maybe millions of people all over Colombia claimed to have felt the force of Olivella’s punches and the ravages of his unpredictability in unexpected situations. A lawyer in a disco, a nun at the door of a supermarket, a bus driver waiting in line at the movie, a whore in a beauty shop, a reporter on a dark street. Olivella had assaulted people and committed petty crimes all over Colombia, and still Avski couldn’t find him. He would disappear like the smoke of a crack pipe until that night in a neighborhood bar with plastic chairs when, wide-eyed and with blood on his shirt, Olivella told him about his last fight against Ernie King, the black junior welterweight from the United States. </p> 
<p>“Everybody was there to see me fight, brotha,” Joseph Avski heard him say as he panned around the bar. “Ya know, it ain’t every day that a champion of my stature comes out of retirement and puts the gloves back on, you know how it is.” Avski didn’t know how to take him; not sure if he was in the stamp of the English gentleman with the Caribbean accent that they all described as temperate, or like the hurricane that destroyed and humiliated everything in its path when he was on something. Avski wasn’t sure either if he was sober and just excited about the interview or if he was high. When he asked Milton what had happened to his lip and why he had a blood stain on his shirt he got a little flustered and replied that he had run into a glass door that he hadn’t seen. </p> 
<p>“That’s what I get, bro, for walking around with my head in the clouds.” But Avski knew it was something different. </p> 
<p> “Ya want me to tell ya?” repeated Milton Olivella while he remembered how he had come out of the locker room like a man from another world. He came out of the dressing room at the bullring in Cartagena that had been set up especially for this fight. Behind him were the seconds that saw the crowd explode in a downpour of applause. Milton raised his hands and let the noise shower down on him. He reached the ring at an ambling walk and said hello one-by-one to the reporters at the press table.</p> 
<p>“Everybody was there to see me fight,” said Milton, taking a look around to make sure that he had the attention of the people at the other tables. “You know, to see a world champion come out of retirement and put the gloves back on, that ain’t an everyday thing, you know how it is. There were people there from all the newspapers and magazines: <i>Cromos, Semana, El Espectador, El Tiempo, El Universal, El Heraldo,</i> not even counting the foreigners, you understand, there were lots of them: gringos, Europeans, Japanese . . . the craziness, just unbelievable.” Milton paused his performance to find the right words. “It was incredible, man, the event of the year.” King entered the other side of the ring snapping jabs in the air to get the audience’s attention, his dark skin contrasting with the white robe he was wearing. Milton took comfort in the idea of King wasting his energy jabbing the air before the fight started. The audience responded to King with whistles and catcalls. “Those people loved me, man.” said Olivella with a slight tremor in his voice. “Nobody had come to see that gringo fight, you know. Everybody was there for me.”</p> 
<p> For a moment Joseph Avski saw him just like he remembered him in the ring: touched by the grace of a divine light. Those were the days when Milton seemed to have been born under Orion’s tutelage, but no, his guiding star was Antares, named by the Arabs Kalb al-Akrab: The Heart of Scorpio. </p> 
<p> Olivella looked around at the unexpected attention from the surrounding tables and the theatricality of his movements increased. “I just danced him in the first round. Just a game of footwork, just feints and hip movement. You know, brotha, how Muhammad Ali danced the first round with Floyd Patterson, you remember in 1975. I got close to him without throwing a single punch just to see what he would throw me to keep me away, or I’d fake him with an overhand right or a hook just to see where he’d defend. That stuff tells ya how to fight him. When ol’ King figured out I wasn’t punching he really got on me but I kept to the plan, you know how it is, bro, beating him with footwork, making space, walking, moving the waist, dancing. That’s the stuff you learn with experience, you know. You don’t win fights by just throwing haymakers. So I figured out how he would attack. That stuff is important, you know why, because when a guy attacks he leaves holes and that’s where you stick the best punches, man. In those holes. He got to me a couple of times, but I was OK, he never hit me hard. But by that point I had him figured out, bro, I already knew what he was gonna do, how he was gonna attack. That right there is the secret to how to win a fight. But the fight didn’t really start until the second round.” </p>

<p>I’ll just tell you one thing: you’re worth what you have. That’s how it is and everybody knows it. Don’t come to me with stories about how he’s a great person when he’s sober and how he brought electricity to Palenque and how he’s admired and respected in the world of boxing, nobody cares if he was world champion or was richer than the Pope, it seems to me if you don’t have anything now, you’re worth nothing now.</p> 
<p> Mama comes out of the kitchen with her big multi-colored robe that she bought at the market with a rag wrapped around her head, she brings me a black coffee. I don’t understand why she’s got to dress like a black woman, like people don’t already know. Anyway, those robes are for poor people and to dress like a poor person is just asking to be poor. </p> 
<p> She took a long time bringing me the coffee but I don’t say anything. Mama is a sensitive woman so it’s best to treat her delicately and not point out her faults. She’s got them, like everybody, but in reality they’re excusable. </p> 
<p> I’ll bring your breakfast in just a minute, she says, and disappears into the kitchen again. </p> 
<p> I light a cigarette to go with the black coffee. The breakfast should have already been ready, but I don’t say anything. Sometimes it’s not easy to be so patient but it gets easier with practice. </p> 
<p> You shouldn’t be smoking so early, says Mama, sticking her head out of the kitchen door. </p> 
<p> I don’t say anything and I keep smoking for a while. The coffee’s not that good. I’ve told her a million times that you have to heat the water before putting it in the coffee maker. But since she doesn’t get up early enough she doesn’t have enough time. And she still takes forever to make the coffee and bring out my breakfast. In spite of all that I keep my mouth shut. Mama comes out of the kitchen, passes by me, and opens the window behind me. As she comes back she puts her hand on my shoulder. </p> 
<p> Is it ready? I ask.</p> 
<p> Just about, she says.</p> 
<p> I told you I’ve got a meeting with the lawyer and I’ve got to get to the office earlier than usual, I say. </p> 
<p> I know, son, it’s just about ready, says Mama.</p> 
<p> It’s like an everyday thing, this waiting for breakfast. Of course, if it were up to me I’d have one woman hired right now to ask us what we want for breakfast and another in charge of making the breakfast. That and lots of other things. But Papa never let me take charge of things and Mama always said it was his money. </p> 
<p> Finally Mama comes out with the plates and puts them on the table. </p> 
<p> I need silverware, I say. </p> 
<p> She goes to the kitchen to get silverware and comes back and sits down. We eat for a little while without saying anything. I think about how it would be if we would have done things my way: everything would be very different.</p> 
<p>He didn’t come home to sleep last night, Mama says</p> 
<p>like it’s something new.</p> 
<p>All the better, I say. </p> 
<p>No, son, I don’t sleep well when Milton doesn’t come home to sleep. </p> 
<p><i>And you don’t sleep well when he does come home</i>, I think. <i>I’m sure you sleep better when he stays away than when he hits you. </i></p> 
<p>Well, <i>I</i> sleep better when he doesn’t come home for the night, I say. </p> 
<p>Son, don’t say that, he’s your father and his place is here with us in the house, says Mama. </p> 
<p>This isn’t his house, I say.</p> 
<p>This is too his house, if it’s not his house then it’s not mine, either, says Mama. </p> 
<p>Whatever, I say. I sleep better when I don’t have to get up in the middle of the night to calm somebody down.</p> 
<p>Son, you just want to look on the bad side of everything, put yourself on the same level as your father when he’s had too much to drink or he’s taken something, but the only way to help your Papa get better is through prayer. </p> 
<p><i>Prayer hasn’t done anything for all these years</i>, I think, but I don’t say anything. I’ll tell you what, though: if we had done things differently we’d all be singing a different tune right now. </p> 
<p>This afternoon I’ve got a meeting with him, I hope he shows, I say. </p> 
<p>It’s about the money? asks Mama. </p> 
<p>Yeah, I say, this morning I meet with the lawyer to get the papers drawn up, so Papa’s pension can be administered between you and me, and then I meet with Papa this afternoon so he can sign them.</p> 
<p>Oh, son, says Mama, I don’t know how I feel about leaving your papa without money to eat. </p> 
<p>He’s never spent a dime of his pension on food, I say. </p> 
<p>Don’t talk like that, son, says Mama trying not to sound indignant. She knows I don’t like people raising their voices at me. </p> 
<p>That money, I say, isn’t enough to pay for all the things he breaks every time he shows up here coked out. </p> 
<p>It’s his money, son, says Mama. We live well on what we have. </p> 
<p>We live well because I work, I say. </p> 
<p>She knows that what I make isn’t enough to maintain this house. She made more when she was a maid for rich women in Cartagena. They paid more just to be able to say that the woman that was cleaning the bathrooms or washing the clothes or making lunch was none other than Ángela Iguarán, Milton Olivella’s wife. </p> 
<p>Now, not only does she make less money working as a maid, she works practically for free as a volunteer at the church. I’ve told her a thousand times that this situation of working with the church isn’t going to cut it or at the least the priest could send us one of his maids to make sure breakfast isn’t late every morning, but I don’t say anything. I’d rather she went back to cleaning houses as a maid because she’s not going to find a better paying job and it’s all she knows how to do – work is work and it’s all worth doing. She says she doesn’t need to because we live well, like she doesn’t remember how we lived before. </p> 
<p>I always finish my breakfast before she does. I light a cigarette. </p> 
<p>Don’t smoke so much, son, she says. </p> 
<p>Is there more black coffee? I ask. </p> 
<p>Yes, she says. </p> 
<p>Bring me more, I say. </p> 
<p>Mama gets up and disappears into the kitchen. She comes back with a cup of coffee and puts it in front of me. I smoke and she keeps eating her breakfast for a while. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Johnny Pitalúa</h4> 
<p>And I said, “It was the first advice I gave him, man, to not trust anyone, everybody here either wants to rip you off or to see you go down because they’re jealous.”</p> 
<p> And Blackie Espinosa said, “That’s it, Ol’ Johnny, you can’t even trust your mama, not even your own mama. But that’s how it is, Ol’ Johnny, you know they was never gonna hand over all that money they offered him.” </p> 
<p> And I said, “I’m going to get more fried plantains and another juice. You want something else?”</p> 
<p> And Blackie said, “No, I’m OK right now.”</p> 
<p> And the lady who sold the beans said, “Here you go,” and she gave me a little wrapped up order of fried plantains and a plastic cup of mango juice. </p> 
<p> I paid her and we started walking to the gym. </p> 
<p> They had already told me. I was talking to my wife about this yesterday. I knew they would try to trick the kid, I already know these people, I saw everything they did to Milton, I said. This kid Miguel is really good, a natural athlete, one in a million and he’s white, you understand, educated, and I know that if he does everything I say and lets me teach him everything I know, he’s going to be a world champion. My wife didn’t say anything. The problem with these people is that they want to get you there as rapidly as possible, which ain’t right because they’ll put you in a title fight before you’re ready, look at Milton, when he fought for the first time against the Argentine in . . . let me see . . . seventy one, I was telling my wife . . . he lost. Aha, there in Luna Park, I was with him and he lost, not because the Argentine was better than him, but because he wasn’t ready, you understand, Milton could have beaten him but he couldn’t beat the way those people supported the Argentine. To fight the guy in Argentina was like nothing we had never felt. Milton mentioned it to me and I agreed with him, that the support that guy had in Argentina was something Milton never felt, not even when he was the richest black guy in Colombia, the cat that slept with the beauty queens and ate lunch with the presidents. Because the difference is that there were ten thousand Argentines coming to see their guy win. And if there were ten thousand Colombians coming to see Milton fight there were ten thousand hoping to see him lose. That’s why when Milton was a world champion and he fought against the Argentine in Caracas, Venezuela and the guys in the Argentine’s corner threw in the towel because their guy was just suffering for no reason, you understand, I was telling my wife, and the fight had been lost two rounds before and there was no way to come back and win, the guy cried from shame in the ring, like a baby, you understand, cried from shame because it wasn’t just him, it was a country. My wife still didn’t say anything. But that’s what I was telling this kid Miguel, that I would put him on the list of aspiring title holders because I didn’t want to what happened to Milton the first time to happen to him, because getting a second shot ain’t easy, you understand, I was telling my wife that I told this kid Miguel, and the important thing is to arrive at the title fight ready to win. That’s what I told him. It’s a shame that the kid picked dangerous people to represent him. They don’t give a flip about his career, they just want to make money off him, you understand. But my wife didn’t say anything because when I rolled over to look at her she was already asleep. </p> 
<p> And I said, “And what does the kid plan to do?” </p> 
<p> And Blackie said, “I don’t know, Johnny, I really don’t know.”</p> 
<p> And I said, “It really bugs me, you know, because the kid was a natural athlete, like Milton, really something special.” </p> 
<p> We got to the gym and while I looked for my keys to open up, Blackie opened up with his keys. We went around hanging up the heavy bags, adjusting the ropes in the ring, taking out the headgear, organizing the jump ropes and gloves, checking the sandbags, etc. What happened with the kid is that some Venezuelan showed up offering him much more money per fight and a trainer with more experience, you understand, but one thing’s for sure, bro, I don’t buy the part about more experience, maybe better opportunities, but more experience, no way. I’ve seen it all, bro, with Milton I learned it all. And sure, cuz, the kid left, you understand. It’s disrespectful, it’s like a betrayal to be left like that, that easily, but I understand that the kid Miguel is young and he believed he had a straight, easy shot to the title and all the money that goes with it. </p> 
<p> The first who comes to train is Efraim, a rich kid who wants to be a writer and thinks that since Edgar Hemingway, or whoever he was, was a boxer and then a writer that he’s going to do the same. One thing’s for sure, though, nobody gets smarter from being smacked upside the head. </p> 
<p> And Efraim shouts when he enters the gym, “Johnny Pitalúa, the coach.” </p> 
<p> And I say, “There’s ol’ Fren, the smart guy.”</p> 
<p> And Efraim says, “Herman Espinosa, named for a great writer.”</p> 
<p> And Blackie says, “Efraim, named after a queer.”</p> 
<p> And Efraim says, “Or a hairdresser, maybe.”</p> 
<p> And Efraim goes to the locker room to change clothes. </p> 
<p> I always told that kid Miguel, don’t waste your best years, don’t make the same mistakes Milton made. I told him that because I knew that at some point someone was going to come try to take my place and I was wanting to keep going with him, to the top, you understand, as part of the team, not as a friend or even as the guy who discovered him, but as his trainer, you understand. </p> 
<p> And Blackie yells at Efraim when he comes out of the locker room, “Warm up and then two-minute bouts with the heavy bag with one-minute rests for forty minutes.” </p> 
<p> Then I see the Kid Óscar “Hands of yams” Manzur. </p> 
<p> So I say, “Kid Óscar ‘Hands of yams’ Manzur, how’s your mama?”</p> 
<p> And Kid Óscar “Hands of yams” Manzur says, “Good, Mista Johnny, she’s back at home.” </p> 
<p> And I say, “I’m glad, cuz, I’m really glad to hear that.” </p> 
<p> And Kid Óscar “Hands of yams” Manzur says, “Thanks for your concern, Mista Johnny.”</p> 
<p> Milton discovered the kid Miguel when he was working here in the gym. One day he saw him fighting in the street because someone had said something about his mama, or no, let me see, it was because they both liked the same girl. Whatever it was, Milton told him to go to the gym and train because he had potential. Milton used to say that he was his student and that he would be a world champion, but that was when he asked me for twenty-five dollars to buy the kid some gloves and he never showed his face at the gym again. </p> 
<p> And Blackie said hello to Manzur, “It’s the man from Ciénaga de Oro.”</p> 
<p> And Kid Óscar “Hands of yams” Manzur said, “The best dressed, richest black man in Cartagena.” </p> 
<p> And Blackie said, “All right, Manzur, all right.”</p> 
<p> And Efraim said, “Hey Espinosa, somebody told me something about the dudes from over there Ciénaga de Oro, in Manzur’s town.” </p> 
<p> And Blackie, “Yeah, what’d they tell you?”</p> 
<p> And Efraim, “That the men over there are such a bunch of queers that the only thing straight over there was a little mango tree in the plaza that had long since flowered.”</p> 
<p> And everybody laughed except me because I was thinking about the kid Miguel and about how he betrayed us by just up and leaving with those Venezuelans like that. </p> 
<p> And Kid Óscar “Hands of yams” Manzur said, “Now, if you want we can spar in a little bit so you see how a queer can knock your ass out.”</p> 
<p> And Efraim laughed again. </p> 
<p> And I said, “Manzur, a little bit of weights and then the heavy bag.”</p> 
<p> And Kid Óscar “Hands of yams” Manzur said, “I’m not doing weights, Mista Johnny, because of that thing with my shoulder.”</p> 
<p> And I said, “Oh, that’s right, cuz, I forgot. Jump rope for forty minutes and then shadowbox with the weighted gloves and that’ll help your shoulder.”</p>

<p>Milton Olivella raised his gaze toward the bar to check to see if he still had the attention of all the surrounding tables. He looked back at the customers seated behind their drinks and took a step backwards between two tables. Milton glanced at the writer who looked at him in rapt attention and then he squared up in a fighting stance. </p> 
<p>“The fight started for real in the second round,” he repeated. “King came out of his corner straight at me as soon as the bell rang. He was young, you understand, and while I had to fight smart, he had energy to spare. I stood like this; you know how it is, looking straight into his eyes, to make him believe I wasn’t running from him anymore and that I was going to throw hands now. But it was pure acting, a bluff, brotha. I already knew I wasn’t going to be able to just go to punchin’, that I’d have to wait for the right moment. And it worked, you understand, because he was a big dude, you know, he had more reach than me and after I stopped him he didn’t dare come at me straight on.” </p> 
<p> Milton Olivella came closer to the table but he didn’t sit down. He downed a double shot of rum and then he squared up again, this time with his right hand forward squeezing a fist and his left back near his chin. He was as thin as a whisper. </p> 
<p>“Ol’ King threw me a weak overhand and I did a little fake with the body.” Milton took two steps back and stayed close to the table. “So he came at me again and I hit him with an overhand right over his guard and made him step back. He threw me a straight left and I threw another right, but neither of us connected. He came at me and I let him clinch me so I could rest and I waited for the referee to separate us. Plus, I knew that King would be distracted and as soon as he let me go I threw him a straight right to the face and I connected. He took two steps back and I took two forward.” </p> 
<p>Milton sent three consecutive straight punches, alternating hands that shot through the bar’s smoky air and he finished with a hook to an invisible man. The people in the bar smiled when they saw the combination. Milton could hear the roar of the crowd and the shouts of his seconds telling him to keep his distance after the punch. In front of him he saw King throw himself over the ropes to maintain his balance. The crowd shouted euphorically after the combination. Milton heard the trainer shout, “Cut him off, cut him off, he’s hurt! The right!” Milton got to King again at the ropes with his hands up. Milton fired a straight-uppercut combination that exploded against the gloves of his opponent. He readied a punch looking for an opening in his opponent’s defense, but when he was ready to throw it King was almost behind him. Milton was disgusted with himself for having missed the opportunity and having lost the money that they had promised him if he won the fight. </p> 
<p>“In the ropes he got by me on one side, bro, and when I turned around he was on top of me and he clinched me. Ol’ King was slick, he would hit with his elbows and with his head, you know how it is. This time he didn’t get me because they yelled at me to keep my face back and because I’m no fool I kept my head away until the referee separated us.” The bell rang and Milton went to his corner where his seconds were ready with a folding chair. He sat down and rested his arms on the ropes. His chest went up and down as his lungs fought to fill themselves with what felt like thin air. Avski detected a melancholy smile that momentarily crossed his disfigured face. He also remembered him seated, in another scene, one where he and his wife had seen Olivella on television. </p> 
<p>Olivella circled his cell in the mental hospital like a caged animal. His bloodshot eyes vacantly panned the cameras that fought for a place on the front row. Some reporters asked questions of Olivella to which he barely responded with signs of astonishment. Suddenly his eyes came alive and he started to speak. He spoke an otherworldly tongue that some say comes from the black spells pronounced in African languages. In Palenque only those who are initiated in the magic arts or sciences can speak them. </p> 
<p>The cameramen snapped photos of the fallen angel as fast as their equipment would let them. A staff member, a bearded man in his forties with round glasses and wearing a white lab coat, intervened to save Olivella from the gang of vampires who fed off of his disgrace. While the reporters left the room thanks to the shoves of the doctor, Milton sunk to the floor and leaned back against the bed. There he covered his face and started to cry, alone, orphaned by his glory. Outside Orion shined with the full splendor of a cloudless night. It shined for others, not for the heart of the Scorpio who sat hunched over, sobbing with bloodshot eyes yellow with his own poison. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Julián</h4> 
<p>Haekermann still hasn’t showed. You would think that being the son of the first Colombian world champion in history would do more for a guy than to get him a job in the sports promotion office in Cartagena. Basically, the fact that my father had been world champion wasn’t worth anything. </p> 
<p> I call Lucero. She doesn’t answer. She said that she wanted us to spend some time apart, wanted to give us some time. She says that she doesn’t have things clear, that she’s afraid of me. I don’t believe she’s got any reason to be afraid of me - it’s just something that happened once, that’s all. It wasn’t my fault; it was just a bad situation: a hard day and an argument with my father. I don’t think that’s a reason to be apart and “give us time.” I bet she’s with someone else. I’ll just say one thing, when someone’s with just one person there’s no room for confusion: they hit the sheets, they talk on the phone two or three times a week and when they’ve got money they get married. That’s it. </p> 
<p> Haeckermann, my boss, shows up. I’ll say one thing for him, he knows how to dress. Today’s he’s all Ralph Lauren from top to bottom. I’ll just tell you one thing: if you’ve got money, you’ve got to show it. Money is for people to see and the best way to do that is with clothes. Money’s not something to throw around on the ground as if it’s going to grow into a mango tree, like my father used to do. When people see you well dressed they know you have class. And that’s the kind of man a woman wants to hit the sheets with, one who’s well dressed. </p> 
<p> You’re here early, Olivella, says my boss. </p> 
<p> I have to leave for a little while in the morning and then again in the afternoon Mister Haekermann, I say. </p> 
<p> Yeah, you were telling me that yesterday, says my boss. </p> 
<p> It’s to sign some papers, I say. </p> 
<p> What papers, Olivella, asks my boss. </p> 
<p> Jews want to know everything. But at least they know how to make money. </p> 
<p> Some . . . some papers about the sale of my father’s property, I say. </p> 
<p> And your father still has something left, asks my boss, I thought he lost it all years ago. Excuse me for saying this to you, but blacks don’t know how to handle money. </p> 
<p> It’s true, he has nothing left, but I don’t say anything. The apartment was the last property my father had but that’s a story I don’t like to remember because if we would have had money it would all have been different, but we didn’t. And we were thrown out in the street like dogs. </p> 
<p> He’s still got what our family has helped him hang on to, I say. </p> 
<p> Haeckermann makes a face and turns around. He always does that when we’re talking too much on work time and he thinks we need to stop talking and get back to work. That’s OK but if he didn’t do that it would be an understandable mistake, it seems to me. </p> 
<p> I’ve already finished arranging everything for the intercollegiate championships, I say. </p> 
<p> Haeckermann turns around and starts to look at the papers. On his left wrist he’s got a little cloth bracelet that says, “I don’t gamble with this hand.” A year ago he almost lost everything. Mama said that nobody says anything about Haeckermann because he’s a Jew and everybody talks about Papa because he’s black. I say no, that the difference is that Haeckermann’s family still lives in Bocagrande and they didn’t throw them out in the street and Haeckermann didn’t wind up begging in the street so he could buy PCP, it seems to me. Because I remember when we moved, that Papa was the first black to live in Bocagrande and that everybody said that in a racist society like Cartagena, which had been one of the world’s primary slave ports, that it was an achievement, an example of how things were changing. But the truth is that the only thing that was important was that we were rich and everybody loved Papa and nobody cared that he was black. I always tell Mama that if we would have done things my way no one would talk bad about Papa and all the women would want to hit the sheets with me. </p> 
<p> That’s fine, says Haeckermann. Everything’s got to be done today for the delegations that are coming to the games. </p> 
<p> I’ll have it done in the afternoon, I say. </p> 
<p> That’s fine, says my boss. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Johnny Pitalúa</h4> 
<p>And then Efraim said, “Tell me about Milton Olivella when he was starting.”</p> 
<p> Efraim always wanted to eat lunch with Blackie Espinosa and me and he always wanted to hear about Milton while we ate. </p> 
<p> And Blackie Espinosa said, “You always go around asking the same stuff.”</p> 
<p> And then Efraim said, “I think I’m going to write a story about Olivella.”</p> 
<p> And I thought about how if someone wrote a story about the kid Miguel when he hits the bigtime they won’t say anything about me. </p> 
<p> And Efraim said, “It’ll be about the fight he had after he had retired.” </p> 
<p> And Blackie Espinosa said, “Aw, come on. So many beautiful moments in Milton’s career and you want to pick the worst one to write about.”</p> 
<p> And Efraim said, “A writer said one time that all the stories of winners are the same, but all the stories of losers are unique, something like that.”</p> 
<p> Then I said, “And why do you need to know how Milton was when he was starting out to tell about his last fight?” </p> 
<p> And Efraim said, “Because something probably happened to him when he was starting out that caused that fight.”</p> 
<p> And Blackie Espinosa said, “Ol’ Johnny, you better tell him to keep him straightened out.” </p> 
<p> And then I said, “This is how it went, cuz, we started training together. That was . . . let me see . . . in sixty-three . . . because in sixty-four we . . . ah yeah, in sixty-three. We went to Turk Samir’s gym because I liked that boxing stuff and somebody had told us that you could make money in that. Turk Samir told us to hit a sand bag and after that he put us to sparring and before we left he took me aside and told me keep bringing the black guy that had come with me, you know, Milton, you understand, cuz. That the guy had talent and I asked him how he knew and he said that you can see those things but didn’t I remember how he had moved that sandbag when he punched it and I said yeah, and he told me that he had moved it more than any other professional in that gym. And that’s how it is. If a guy has talent you can tell.”</p> 
<p> And then Efraim told me with a mouthful of rice, “But I read that Milton was a disaster at first.”</p> 
<p> And I said, “Oh, don’t misunderstand, cuz, Milton was always a hell of a good guy. He’d have never gone with those Venezuelans or none of that stuff, you understand. From the beginning he wanted to have famous friends, live the good life, eat exotic foods, and all that stuff, but you have to say that he never turned his back on his friends from before, never forgot about the poor. The fact is, cuz, no, never. You know he never forgot about his people, you understand, you know all the stuff he did for Palenque. I remember when we were working, cutting lawns at the houses in the Manga neighborhood, one time the owner of the house came out dressed in a coat and tie, really elegant, I thought, but Milton started telling me how when he was going to be rich he wasn’t going to dress like that, and I asked him how, and he said with a tie and shirt that don’t go together, and I said what the hell do you know about any of that, since he never in his life had worn either ties or dress shirts and he told me those were things he knew about. Turk Samir used to tell his wife that Milton had something no one else had and I understand that. It’s a rare thing and I don’t know how to define it but it’s like the time that the kid came up to us begging for money. Milton and I had been selling fish door to door, barefoot, out in a sun that’ll kill ya. You don’t know what that is, cuz, because you’re a kid that was born into money, but it’s something that I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy: your feet breaking on that saltpeter and that hot ground, your head hurtin’ from the sun, the dry throat, the sweat, ugly stuff, cuz, ugly. What happened was that after being out there all day selling fish door to door we got enough money to get ourselves some plantains, rice and eggs to bring home, or well, some to my house and some to Milton’s house. Since it was getting dark we decided to knock on one more door. A lady came out and she told us that she didn’t need fish but she asked us if we had eaten anything and we told her that we hadn’t eaten anything since the morning and the lady brought us out plates with fried plantains with sauce and cheese for each of us and a cold drink. And just when we were starting to eat a little kid came up to the house to beg for money and the lady told him that she didn’t have money and she had just given us all the leftover food she had in the house. So when the little kid turned around to go Milton called him and he gave him his food. I told him to not give him anything, that he could work same as us and Milton told me, Let it go, brotha, that kid was hungry. You understand, cuz.”</p> 
<p> And Efraim said, “But I wasn’t talking about that Ol’ Johnny, I meant how he was as a boxer.”</p> 
<p> And then I, “Well, that’s another story.”</p> 
<p> And Efraim, “Tell me.” </p> 
<p> And so I told him, “Milton didn’t like to train and he didn’t give a shit about boxing. He had the longest losing streak of anybody you ever heard of, he would just stand there in the ring and he didn’t move, didn’t punch, didn’t protect, didn’t slip, like if the building fell on him it wasn’t nothing to him. The people hated him. There were only two types of black fighters that got people’s attention in those days, them that fought for the honor of their race, and so all the blacks in Cartagena went to see ‘em fight (and that’s what I wanted to be, you understand); or them niggers that thought they were something special, and every white guy in the city went hoping to see ‘em lose. Milton wasn’t either of the two. His fights were so boring that he had to change his name every bout because if people knew it was Milton that was one of the fighters they wouldn’t buy tickets. Before the fights he’d ask me to do him the favor of going and betting against him, and of course he always won the bet, you know, lost the fight, you understand. He had a streak of fifteen fights lost and not a single win: worse than me. Of course I trained like crazy, I wanted to be good, fight in the United States, meet Muhammad Ali, but the harder I tried the worse I got, and the only person I easily beat was Milton.” </p> 
<p> And Efraim asked with a chicken breast in his hand, “And what changed all that?” </p> 
<p> Blackie Espinosa chewed a piece of yuca dipped in sauce and looked at me. He had heard the stories about Olivella a thousand times but he always wanted to hear them again. </p> 
<p> And I said, “Well, it was an odd change, you understand. The first thing that happened was that he won his first fight. Turk Samir had lined him up to fight Blondie Higgins and so the people wouldn’t know it was him he called Milton the Black Menace. It just so happened that Blondie Higgins, who was also fighting under an assumed name and the result of the fight didn’t affect his fight record (that stuff was very common in those days, you can’t do it now), asked a cousin of his to go offer money to Milton to lose in the fifth round. Milton accepted without any idea that Blondie Higgins was playing a joke on him. The fight started and in the first round Higgins just laid out. Higgins had just barely hit the canvas when people started to whistle and boo. The referee started to count One, two, and Milton crouched down close to where Higgins was laying and told him to get up, that he hadn’t touched him, and the referee kept counting Three, Four, and Higgins on the canvas, and Milton told him, Get up, bro, it’s for a good cause, and the referee Five, Six, and Blondie Higgins on the canvas showing no signs of life and Milton worried because he was going to lose the money they had offered him to throw the fight in the fifth round. Get up, bro, seriously, you’re gonna make me lose the money on the deal I made, Eight, and Higgins, nothing, there on the canvas like he had been hit with the slobberknocker of all times, and Milton telling him, Get up, brotha, you’re making me look like a dumbass, and the referee Nine, and Milton shouted in this thunderous voice, Get up, stop screwin’ around, I didn’t touch you. Oh, people got so mad, cuz, I’m talking about so mad when they heard Milton yell that they wanted to lynch everybody. We had to run out of there, not just Milton and Higgins, but everybody, even those of us who hadn’t fought. We had to leave gloves, shorts, creams, and all that stuff in there and run for our lives. The Turk pitched a shitfit like you read about, you can’t even imagine, because he had lost all that money and all that stuff that we never recovered. They kicked them both out of the gym right there. Higgins went to Venezuela and did well over there and Milton went to sell fish and wash cars.”</p> 
<p> And Efraim interrupted, “But -” </p> 
<p> And I said, “Hang on, cuz, I’ll get to that. I told you it was an odd change. One day Milton showed up at the gym with a gentleman, you understand. The man went in behind closed doors with Turk Samir and Milton stayed outside the office with me. I asked him who he was and he told me it was his old man. The guy had abandoned them when Milton was six years old and he had gone to Venezuela with a neighbor that he had gotten pregnant. Milton never wanted to tell me what his old man had said, the only thing Turk Samir told me is that Milton’s daddy had asked him to take his son back in the gym, that he was sure things would be different and Milton’s father said he did it as a work of charity. Asking that favor for Milton was the only thing his father ever did for him in his entire life. That was the last time Milton saw his old man. From that point on he started to be, you know, disciplined and all that stuff.” </p> 
<p> And Efraim, “But what did the father tell Milton?”</p> 
<p> And I said, “Ah, that’s what I don’t know, cuz, because Milton never wanted to tell me.”</p> 
<p> And then Efraim asked, “And after that he never saw his father again?”</p> 
<p> And I said, “Never. When he fought in Venezuela we tried to find him and we got him on the phone, but the guy never wanted to see Milton.”</p> 
<p> And Efraim, “How’s that?” </p> 
<p> And I, “Well, Milton was able to talk with his old man on the phone and he told him he had brought a few gifts from Colombia and he was going to give him some money, but the guy said no, that he only had one family and he wanted to be left alone. That stuff hit him real hard, you understand, luckily it was after the fight because if it wasn’t, Milton would have been really low, but he never wanted to talk about that either.”</p> 
<p> Then Blackie Espinosa said, “It’s time, Ol’ Johnny,” and we got up to go back to the gym. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">* * *</h4>
<p>For a few days the image of Milton Olivella sitting on the floor leaning back against the hospital bed was a recurring theme in Avski’s dreams. The scene, always as clear as when Avski first saw it, never appeared through the gauzy filter of sleep and it was never populated with other characters. The dream was always just like he had seen on TV: Milton leaning back against the hospital bed in a patient’s gown crying like a helpless child. Joseph didn’t tell anyone about the nightly recurrence, sure as he was that it would disappear sooner or later. But his wife understood that the only way for Avski to exorcise the image was to find out how and why the great champion Milton Olivella had reached such a desperate situation. Just like everybody else in Colombia, Avski vaguely knew some of the reasons, but he didn’t know the fine details needed to break the dream’s hold on him. </p> 
<p> Avski’s wife woke him up one Sunday with coffee and a phone number written in blue marker on a ripped piece of cereal box. “It’s the phone number for Dr. Gerard Lefebvre,” she said, “from the San Pablo Psychiatric Hospital.” Avski looked at her, disconcerted. “He’s the doctor who treated Milton Olivella over there,” she explained. And thus was initiated the search that led Joseph to write this story. </p> 
<p> Avski looked through his notes for references of the interview with the doctor. He read and organized the ideas in his head before going back to the keyboard. He reread a little of what he had written and continued: </p> 
<p>“The first time that Dr. Lefebvre saw Milton Olivella in person was before he worked in the San Pablo Psychiatric Hospital: he was working in the emergency room in the Cartagena University Hospital. At that time Milton had been left at the door of the emergency room by a Hilux pickup truck that sped off into the night without waiting to see if someone came to get him. When the orderlies came to get the body stretched out on the sidewalk they realized he had a knife wound in the right buttocks that looked like it had been bleeding for several hours. Dr. Gerard Lefebvre came out and saw him and told the orderlies to pick him up and bring him inside. Lefebvre tried to take off the wounded man’s clothes to examine the wound but Milton woke up and grabbed the waistband of his pants, arguing that the only thing the doctor was trying to do was to rob him. Lefebvre had Milton sedated and when Olivella finally couldn’t resist, the nurses got his clothes off and found a paper sack full of little plastic bags of cocaine hidden under Olivella’s testicles. Milton still claims that the nurses stole a bunch of cash that he had on him while he was sedated, although he didn’t dare accuse Dr. Lefebvre, who saved his life. According to the nurses, if the wound had not been sutured in time Milton would have bled to death. </p> 
<p>Milton had been Dr. Gerard Lefebvre’s patient years before in the University Hospital in Cartagena and once again was his patient in the San Pablo Psychiatric Hospital. Andrés Pastrana, conservative candidate for the presidency of the republic, had called in the morning to tell Lefebvre he wanted to come see Olivella. Lefebvre responded that he didn’t mind, as long as the visit was secret and didn’t turn into a publicity stunt for political purposes. Dr. Lefebvre agreed to the visit but clarified that Olivella’s psychological state was delicate. He recommended that the visit be private, far from cameras and microphones and free from political pretensions. </p> 
<p>The friendship had been forged more than twenty years prior. In those days Misael Pastrana Borrero, Andrés’ father, was president of Colombia and Milton Olivella was the world champion junior welterweight. That was when the president invited him to the government palace, publicly praised him, and held him up as an example for all Colombians. Olivella thanked the president by putting his weight behind the president’s agenda, participating in public events and allowing his fame to be leveraged politically. In exchange, Milton requested help for his hometown, government attention that it had never received. </p> 
<p>In those days Andrés was an eighteen year old kid with clear political aspirations, spending his free time organizing street marches in Bogota. That was when the friendship between Milton and Andrés started, based more on mutual interest than affection, and it continued for more than twenty years. </p> 
<p>From the 28th of October of 1972, when Olivella won the title, the country that had rejected him for being poor, ugly and black now hung on every single detail of his life. The same heavies who controlled the TV programming and didn’t want to televise Olivella’s first title fight because they thought that boxing was for the blacks and the poor now paid to see his apartment in Bocagrande, or to watch the stylist at the Reinado beauty salon trim Milton’s hair and moustache. <i>El Universal</i> hired a reporter who for more than five years had no other responsibility than to follow Olivella’s footsteps. <i>El Espacio</i> never missed a single detail of the champ’s love life and put him on more than five hundred front pages, each showing him with a different woman. Between 1973 and 1980 <i>El Tiempo</i> dedicated more pages of the cultural section to Milton Olivella than to Nobel Prize-winning novelist Gabriel Garc’a Márquez. The magazine <i>Semana</i> dedicated three special editions to the champ. The first reviewed Olivella’s sophisticated musical tastes. The second revealed his favorite foods and drinks, a mix of international cuisine and local favorites that graced the table in the home of the king of the 140 pound class. The last, titled, ‘Colombia’s Best Dressed Man,’ featured the contents of his closet. <i>El Espectador</i> asked Gabriel Garc’a Márquez to write a chronicle about the occult forces that helped Milton but the novelist abandoned the project because he considered them to be very powerful forces in which he preferred not to meddle. The only thing that came out of their private meetings was that the spirits that accompanied Olivella in the ring came from the heart of Africa and that he had received them as part of a blood pact in exchange for glory in the ring. </p> 
<p>Olivella’s influence was so great that when he stated in a radio interview that the seafood empanadas at the Pegasus pier in Cartagena had aphrodisiac powers they sold out in a matter of hours and exhausted the supply of shellfish in the whole country within the week. It was said in Cartagena that he could, with a word, place councilmembers and mayors, and that in his best days he could have gotten more votes for president than the entire Conservative Party.” </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">* * *</h4> 
<p>“A blood pact in exchange for glory in the ring,” thought Olivella sitting with his arms resting on the ropes with his eyes closed, when the sound of the bell snapped him back into the present. It was common for Olivella to daydream during a fight. He stood up in his corner and saw King full of energy and coming toward him. He made space between a chair and a table, downed a shot of rum, chased it with a swallow of beer and steeled himself for King&laquo;s onslaught. </p> 
<p>He told about the fight as if he were there at the present moment, as if he had told it many times. “I walked him around the ring a little trying to get to his side. I was moving towards the corners and towards the center but him, nothing; he punched and punched and never got tired or let his guard down. I raised my guard and he moved away from me looking for a long distance punch, something he felt like he could connect with the right. He was trying to sense when my defense was opening up. You, know, brotha, he had a longer reach than me, he was taller than me and that long-distance fight worked to his advantage. I tried to wear him down but he was a young guy, you know how it is. At the start of the third I decided to surprise him. As soon as the referee motioned for us to come out of our corners, I walked right up to him and hit him with a combination. I figured if I could catch him, he&laquo;d be done: knockout. But nothin&laquo; doin&laquo; brotha, the boy was slick; he got by me on the right side and clinched me. I was tired and I leaned on him to rest, you know how it is, brotha, you put all your weight on him and you rest, and the other guy gets tired, while I hit him in the ribs, you know, bro, those punches take it out of &laquo;em, they wear &laquo;em down, but ol&laquo; King was an old dog and he nailed me with a headbutt that opened up my right eyebrow. When they separated us I made like I was just gonna wait on him, you know how it is, like I was saying, ‘I&laquo;m getting ready for ya, you stay over there and I&laquo;ll wait for you over here’ and he got distracted for a second. He believed it and relaxed a little, and I hit him with a short, quick combination to the midsection.” Milton gave a little jump to the side of a table and put together some low, quick punches without going to the trouble of keeping his guard up. The crowd made a sound like a big wind entering through an open window. The punches bounced off King&laquo;s midsection like asphalt and Milton threw a big right hand that sailed up and looked for King’s unprotected chin. King avoided the punch and let loose a hook that exploded against Milton’s ribs. “Sometimes you can see things in slow motion during the fight. It’s a strange thing, brotha. When King nailed me in the ribs I started to see everything in slow motion, you understand me. Sometimes it happens because something hurts real bad, like in my ribs, but it also happens when you see a little daylight in the other guy’s defense and you stick your hand in there and send him to the mat, you see that in slow motion, too. I thought, ‘OK, brotha, let’s go, let’s go, this is the fight you gotta win, this is the one that’s gonna pull you out of the mud. From now on it’s all uphill, no more chances, if you lose this one it’s all over.’” King moved two steps to get to Milton. He launched a straight punch with each hand, starting with the right, that bashed against Milton’s defense and then, before stepping back, an upper cut that hit nothing thanks to Olivella’s hip movement. “That’s it, bro, that’s it, taking care of those ribs,” thought Milton. “It’s over; he had his turn, now it’s yours.” </p>

<p>I call Lucero again and she doesn’t answer. I put the phone down and leave for the lawyer’s office. </p> 
<p> <i>Armando Carre–o, Attorney</i> reads a gold plaque on the office door. The secretary tells me to wait for “the doctor” to be free. I explain to her that I’m in a hurry and she says it shouldn’t take more than five minutes. </p> 
<p> She’s not bad. She’s got dark, straight hair and dark eyes and cinnamon skin. She’s wearing a Gap shirt that doesn’t show good taste but shows that she’s making an effort. I bet she’d hit the sheets with me. </p> 
<p> You want me to call you later, I ask.</p> 
<p> I have a boyfriend, sir, she responds. </p> 
<p> It seems like the lawyer is doing well and makes good money and there’s no doubt that he’s getting it on with the secretary. It’s a big office and everything looks clean and elegant. There are books with photos of Cartagena that people can look at while they wait. </p> 
<p> The secretary tells me I can go in Carre–o’s office. I don’t know what was keeping “the doctor” busy because no one came out of his office when I went in. It’s an old lawyer trick: make the clients wait so they seem much more important. The problem is that you have to have money to do that; if you don’t, you know, nobody waits for a person without money. </p> 
<p> It’s a big office with walls lined with books. No doubt he’s one of those people who hasn’t read a single one of the books in his office. I wouldn’t waste my money on a library. It’s the most useless thing you can think of. </p> 
<p> The lawyer is real friendly when he greets me and he recognizes me on the spot. He says he’s a great admirer of my father, that he’s a person who’s given much to Colombia, bla, bla, bla. He’s wearing a John Varvatos suit which says that he’s got good taste and he goes to the United States to buy clothes. But really, it’s nothing that my father wouldn’t have worn in another time. </p> 
<p> So to get down to business I explain, What my father and mother and I want is for the pension that the government gives to my father for the honor that he bestowed on Colombia to be controlled by me instead of by him. </p> 
<p> I see, said Carre–o. In other words, you’d be the new administrator of that pension. </p> 
<p> No, my mother would be the pension administrator, I say. </p> 
<p> And what do you need a legal proceeding for if all the parties involved are in agreement? asks Carre–o. </p> 
<p> I make a face like I don’t understand. </p> 
<p> It seems to me like if everyone agrees, explains Carre–o, the easiest thing to do would be for your father to hand over the money to your mother every month. </p> 
<p> What’s going on is that with my father’s drug problems, he’d rather not have the temptation so close to him, I say. </p> 
<p> Ah. And why not put in the document that your mother will be the one who will receive the money from the pension, asks Carre–o. </p> 
<p> You know, Mom is getting up in years and it’s better not to expose her to all the bureaucratic red tape and have her wait in line every month, I say. </p> 
<p> For a document of that kind we need the signature of all the parties, the lawyer tells me. We’ll revise the paperwork and you can go get all the signatures and come back to the office and we’ll make the document legal. We shook hands and said goodbye. When I was about to leave the office the lawyer told me to say hello to my father and tell him he’s a great admirer. </p> 
<p> I leave the office with the revised paperwork and the secretary doesn’t say goodbye to me, so I don’t even turn around to wave to her. </p> 
<p> In the elevator I’m thinking all about it. It occurs to me that he asked me all those questions to try to get me to bribe him, as if what I was asking him to do was against the law. He’s not a guy capable of sacrificing, this lawyer Carre–o. He’s not someone who would take care of his mother like I’m doing. That’s why he’s got an office like that. You can’t be a good person and be successful in business. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Johnny Pitalúa</h4> 
<p>That kid Miguel could be fighting for the title in a year and a half or two years if he would have stayed with me. Nobody else in this gym is a title contender. That’s a thing you can see in a fighter, you understand. Like when Turk Samir clapped eyes on Milton the first time we went to his gym. But that business of going off with the Venezuelans and turning his back on everything I’ve done for him here is ingratitude, you understand me. </p> 
<p>And then I said, “Hard, ‘Hands of yams’, hard. You hit like that you won’t knock down your grandma.”</p> 
<p>“Hands of yams” is a dedicated man and he’s not a bad fighter but he’s never going to fight for a world title. That’s how I was. Well, no not really. This kid has his strong points but doesn’t have the stuff of a real champion; I didn’t have anything, some desire but nothing else. If he’s lucky he’ll win a couple of important fights, make a little money and retire with some recognition. At the end of the day, fighters like “Hands of yams” are more important because they’re the ones that can surprise you and make the sport. When you really think about it, a lot of world champions really didn’t have the stuff of a champion, just discipline and good luck, because if there’s not a great reigning champion, like Milton or Muhammad Ali or Mike Tyson, somebody who has to have the crown, then that’s an opportunity for the good fighters who may not have championship stuff. If in boxing there were only the great world champions, we’d only have a fight about every eight years, you understand. </p> 
<p>And I said, “Harder, harder. When you move me <i>and</i> the bag with one punch you can say you’ve got a punch to fight for a world title.”</p> 
<p>And then Kid Óscar “Hands of yams” Manzur said, “Milton moved you and the bag and everything when he hit?”</p> 
<p>And I, “Of course, me and one more guy. It was impressive, cuz.”</p> 
<p>And there’s the point, the kid Miguel had the talent and desire, one in a million, you understand, and the discipline, the will, the desire, cuz, the desire. </p> 
<p>And Blackie Espinosa said, “They’re looking for you, Ol’ Johnny.”</p> 
<p>I let go of the sandbag and turned around. Standing next to Espinosa was the kid Miguel with his backpack on his shoulder. </p> 
<p>And I said, “What a miracle, Migue’! How you doin’?”</p> 
<p>And the kid Miguel said, “You got time for a cup of coffee, Ol’ Johnny?”</p> 
<p>So when we went for the coffee the kid Miguel said, “Ol’ Johnny, here’s the deal. Those dudes ain’t legal, you understand, they were telling me that they were going to give me some money to fight and afterwards they gave me less, and stuff like that.”</p> 
<p>The kid Miguel took a sip of coffee and kept going, “I thought they were on my team, people I could trust, the ones that have your back and all that stuff; but if you can’t trust your team you’re screwed. It’s just . . . I don’t feel good like that, Ol’ Johnny.”</p> 
<p>And I said, “That’s how those people are, cuz, I told you a thousand times.”</p> 
<p>I stirred the sugar that had settled in the bottom of the coffee cup. </p> 
<p>And the kid Miguel said, “You’re exactly right, Ol’ Johnny, exactly right. But here’s the deal, sometimes you gotta learn for yourself the hard way, you understand, you don’t learn from other people’s mistakes. It’s just that, when I went with those guys I believed in everything that you had told me about who to trust, it’s just that I thought these guys I went with were gonna be OK, you understand, you always think that you’re gonna have better luck than everybody else. It’s like when you get married, Ol’ Johnny, you think you’re never gonna have the same problems other people have in their marriages, you know, less problems than your folks had, you think your marriage is gonna be the only perfect one, Ol’ Johnny, the only perfect one.”</p> 
<p>And I, “That’s how it is, Migue’.”</p> 
<p>And the kid Miguel, “The deal is that I want to come back to the gym, Ol’ Johnny, here with the people, and I want you to manage my stuff, like before. I know I screwed up, ol’ man, and that I hurt you, but I realized that this is the only place where people are gonna be interested in my career, and not just tryin’ to get money out of me. We were a team here and that’s what’s most important, Ol’ Johnny. It really is.” </p> 
<p>The kid Miguel sat there for a minute without saying anything waiting for me to say something, but I didn’t say anything. </p> 
<p>And then the kid Miguel said, “Ol’ Johnny, I learn from my mistakes, you know, and I learned this lesson like they say. I’m man enough to tell you I screwed this up and you and Blackie Espinosa and Olivella had warned me and I went off first thing and screwed it up, but I’m also man enough to tell you that this is my team and my team to the death.” </p> 
<p>And then I said, “You’re getting all philosophical on me, cuz.”</p> 
<p>And the kid Miguel, “Of course, Ol’ Johnny, absolutely. This is serious, Ol’ Johnny, on my mother’s life. Boxing is my life, you know, and I want to go far and to go far you need a solid team, you know, teamwork . . .”</p> 
<p>And I said, “Well, enough speechmaking, cuz, better finish that coffee and go change.”</p> 
<p>And then the kid Miguel went wide-eyed and said, “No shit? Thanks, Ol’ Johnny, really, I won’t let you down.” </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">* * *</h4> 
<p>It was the second fight against the Argentine Marturet where Olivella took the punch that hurt him. The first fight was in 1971, the year before Olivella won the title. Marturet was the reigning champion and Olivella faced him as the challenger. Luna Park[1] was overflowing with people and from the beginning Milton knew who was beating him. It wasn’t the Argentine’s punches; it was the delirious support of the multitude that filled that arena. Marturet was the pride of a country that lifted up its heroes to never let them back down, a country that never would abandon them. It was a sensation that he never felt in his own country, there was never a Colombian crowd that would intimidate a foreign fighter. But the fight where he got hurt was a lot later, in 1976, in the second fight against Marturet, where Olivella was the champion and the Argentine was the contender. The fight was unequal from the very beginning. Marturet, an excellent fighter, especially agile, already had a lot of fights and years under his belt but his speed and power weren’t what they once were. From the beginning, Olivella punished him with impunity. Bap, to the face of Marturet, bam, a shot to the mouth, boom boom, a cross and a hook to the body of the Argentine who staggered, bang, a straight to the eyebrow that started to bleed, bap, bap, two straight overhands to the bleeding eyebrow, boom, a hand of stone ripped his lips open. The Argentine took the beating and held on to the ropes to keep from falling. He clinched Olivella, ran from him for entire rounds, avoided taking him on and clinched him again to keep from fighting. Every now and then he’d throw wild punches with everything he had hoping to win the fight with a knockout. One of those punches caught Milton in the ribs and had him spitting blood for nearly a month. The fight ended when somebody from Marturet’s corner threw in the towel. Olivella raised his arms and celebrated. When he got back to the dressing room he recognized Marturet’s dry mournful cry. </p> 
<p>Olivella’s narration was interrupted by a group of men who entered the bar who breathlessly told what they knew about a tragedy that happened barely a block away. It seems that a man had given a prostitute such a severe beating that she died. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Julián</h4> 
<p>I call Lucero one more time. No answer. It was a good day to get laid. </p> 
<p> I look for something for lunch. Something cheap. I’m not the kind of person who spends money on lunch paying for nice furniture, well dressed waiters and cooks who studied in France. It’s a shame what happened to my father: first he didn’t even have enough to eat, then he only ate in exclusive restaurants, and now he begs for food on the street. That’s never happening to me. </p> 
<p> Now that I think about it I’m going home for lunch. I stop a taxi and get in. </p> 
<p> When I get home I hear my mother praying.</p> 
<p> . . . when almost all hope is lost. Come and help me in this great need, so that I can receive counsel and heavenly help in all my needs, tribulations, and suffering, particularly for my husband Milton so that you can free him from the demon of vice that torments him . . . </p> 
<p> I leave my things in the living room and go to the dining room where I see my mother kneeling in front of a little statue of Saint Jude and a little framed picture stuck on the wall. That Saint Jude looks a little too good to be an apostle, it seems to me. Although, of course, a guy like that with money would make all the women religious and then he could hit the sheets with them all. In real life he never looked like in that painting, it seems to me. If he had looked like that he wouldn’t have been an apostle, unless he was poor. </p> 
<p> Is lunch ready, I ask. </p> 
<p> Just a minute, son, she says without turning around to see me and she keeps praying . . . and so that he can praise God with you and with all the elect forever. </p> 
<p> I light a cigarette and I sit behind her to wait for lunch. From where I sit I can see Mama and Saint Jude. If somebody looks like that and has money he can get a lot of women to hit the sheets with him, it seems to me. </p> 
<p> I give thanks to you, glorious Saint Jude, Mama continues, and I promise to never forget this great favor, to honor you forever as my powerful patron saint, and with thanks, I will do all I can to encourage others to be devoted to you. Amen. </p> 
<p> My mother gets up and cleans off her knees. Before coming over to give me a kiss on the cheek she opens the window and puts out the lighted candle in front of the statue of the saint. </p> 
<p> I’ll bring you your lunch, son, she says to me and she disappears into the kitchen. I sit there smoking and thinking about all the women I’d hit the sheets with if I had money and looked like Saint Jude. Lucero wouldn’t have quit answering the phone and she wouldn’t have said that “it’s just that sometimes you scare me.” </p> 
<p> It seems like Mama had all the lunch ready beforehand because it doesn’t take long to come out. She says she was waiting for me and that I should go wash my hands while she sets the table. At least I don’t have to wait as long as I did for breakfast. I come back with my hands washed and I sit down to eat. How did it go with the lawyer, Mama asks. </p> 
<p> He says we all three have to sign the document, I say. </p> 
<p> And your papa agrees, asks Mama. </p> 
<p> He agreed the last time we talked about it, I say. </p> 
<p> When I saw him he was just being released from the San Pablo Psychiatric Hospital. He looked a little skinny but younger, and of course, not high. That’s not going to last long, it seems to me. There’s no doubt he’s already lost. </p> 
<p> I think we should leave at least a little bit for your father, says Mama. </p> 
<p> That pension is pitifully small, I say. </p> 
<p> We continue eating in silence for a while. </p> 
<p> You like the food, son, asks Mama. </p> 
<p> It’s not bad, I say, and we keep eating until Mama interrupts. </p> 
<p> When are you going to meet with Papa, she asks. </p> 
<p> This afternoon, I say. </p> 
<p> Don’t be hard on him, says Mother. </p> 
<p> Is there more meat, I ask. </p> 
<p> Mama gets up and takes my plate to the kitchen. She comes back a moment later with my plate and sits down. </p> 
<p> We have to pray, says Mama. Prayer is the only way to defeat the demon that torments your father, remember the time when Papa worked in the gymnasium with Johnny Pitalúa. </p> 
<p> Of course I remember that time. Mama spent all day giving thanks out loud: Thank you, Sacred Heart, for anointing a miracle with your holy blood, thank you. Most Holy Virgin, thank you for hearing my prayers and intervening, thank you Saint Jude, cousin of Jesus, patron saint of lost causes, for touching my husband with your power. </p> 
<p> Johnny is the only friend Milton’s had, says my mother, the only one who tried to cure him instead of taking him down. He’s a good man, touched by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. We should invite him to come over and pray with us for Milton. </p> 
<p> There’s no cure for Papa, I say, not prayer, not anything else is going to cure him. </p> 
<p> Don’t talk like that son, says Mama, her voice breaking, don’t judge him like that. What he needs is our love and a lot of prayer. Only God can save your father, only Him, and she looks like she’s going to cry. I don’t look at her and keep eating. </p> 
<p> That’s what the doctor said, I say, when she stops crying. That what Papa has is a hereditary mental illness. </p> 
<p> The drugs . . . the dru . . . says Mama and she goes to crying. </p> 
<p> He said the drugs magnified the sickness and made the episodes stronger and closer together, but that doesn’t mean . . . , I say, but Mama interrupts me. </p> 
<p> But without the drugs the sickness can be controlled, says Mama sobbing, the enemy is the drugs, the . . . the . . . the . . . the demon, says Mama. If Milton would have gone to that hospital in Cuba it all would have been different. </p> 
<p> I don’t say anything for fear of throwing her off and I keep eating. After a little while she keeps talking. </p> 
<p> All this pain is because the Lord has a mission for Milton, says mother, a very important mission to be an example and a testimony. God’s plans are unknowable, but perfect. </p> 
<p> I don’t think Papa has a mission, I say. </p> 
<p> I’m going to pray for you, Julián, says Mama, for the Lord to give you faith. </p> 
<p> I’m not going to put up with you talking to me like that, like you think you’re better than me. So faith was going to enable us to keep our house and keep them from throwing us out in the street like dogs, I say. </p> 
<p> It wasn’t the Lord Jesus’ fault they took our house away, said Mama. </p> 
<p> No, but he didn’t do anything to keep them from taking it, I said. </p> 
<p> And why didn’t you do anything, Julián, Mama asks me as if it’s my fault. </p> 
<p> And what the fuck was I going to do, you never let me take care of Papa’s money and you didn’t want to clean people’s houses, I say. </p> 
<p> You could have taken advantage of a chance to not depend on anyone, says Mama. </p> 
<p> What opportunities, I ask. When it came time for me to go to the university there was already no money left to send me to study in the United States. </p> 
<p> And why didn’t you study here, like I offered you, says Mama. That’s why I cleaned people’s houses and I put up with all the humiliation that those ladies put me through because they hated me because I was black and used to have more money than they did. I had already known a different life and I didn’t want the same misery for you. By now you would have finished school and you’d have a good job. </p> 
<p> I didn’t want to study here, I said. </p> 
<p> It’s better to go through life feeling sorry for yourself, says Mama. </p> 
<p> I raise my hand to her and she leans away to avoid the slap but she looks at me without fear. </p> 
<p> Stop blaming others for your mediocrity, Julián, because there’s nobody else to blame, says Mama. </p> 
<p> I won’t put up with you talking to me like you’re better than me. I take a step forward but I hold back and I walk out of the apartment. </p>

<p>Avski writes, </p> 
<p> “Milton Olivella was born on October 27, 1945 in the Caribbean village of San Basilio de Palenque, years before it was declared a Patrimonial Heritage Site. Back then, just like when I visited with my wife, Palenque was a deathtrap of houses made of bitter palm, tied up with reeds and walls pasted over with a mix of sand and burro dung. Laid out on four streets that came together on an esplanade on the other side of the cemetery and an arroyo named El Caballito, it looks the same as when it was founded by slaves escaped from Cartegena in the 17th century. </p> 
<p> Of the Patrimonial Heritage there’s little left: the African dialects that were supposedly still spoken, are deader than Aramaic, replaced by an illiteracy that spans across all languages. The only thing the inhabitants know anymore is that Milton Olivella was born here. Anybody can tell you with their eyes closed where he lived, where his grandparents lived, where he played and everybody without exception points out the remains of the water pipes and the powerlines that looked like the ruins of the Roman Coliseum once they took off the cables to do maintenance and then never came back. They remember the time when they were the center of the western world. If it weren’t for Milton, they say, we’d have never had running water and electricity. You know, Garc’a Márquez tried to get electricity to Aracataca and he couldn’t. </p> 
<p> In 1953, when Milton was eight years old, Mrs. Adelina Cassiani made the decision to move with her family to Cartagena. Miguel de Jesús Olivella, Milton’s father, had gone to Venezuela to find a better tomorrow, but after two years without hearing from him Adelina decided not to wait any longer. </p> 
<p> In Cartagena, Adelina’s family was taken in by her cousin, Rosalinda Cassiani. The first impressions that she had of the city were negative, remembers the fighter’s mother. The only option for a poor black family in the racist Cartagena of those years was to live in Chambacú, a squatter neighborhood built with what was at hand out of leaves, sheet metal, plastic, and cardboard, at the mercy of the stinking vapors of the Chambacú and El Cabrero lagoons, and with the streets covered with the excrement of whatever animals could coexist with people. There was no electricity, no water, no sewerage, no paved streets, no streetlights, no sanitary services, no health services, not anything. The first thing Adelina thought was that they had been better off in Palenque, where at least the rain or the tide would keep the crap out of your living room. </p> 
<p> From the time Milton arrived in Cartagena he went to work. He started with his Aunt Rosalinda selling fish in the market, after with his aunt’s friend selling fruit to the tourists on the beach, later washing cars, carrying packages, in construction, doing household chores for rich families, or whatever else presented came up. ‘He was always a good boy,’ says Adelina. The whole country knew that, when all the newspapers showed Adelina in front of a new house with a freezer and a washing machine in a well-to-do neighborhood in Cartagena. Milton had repeatedly expressed since his first interview that his life’s dream was to buy his mother her own house. Now he was even saying that he wanted to give her a house in the best neighborhood in the city but his mother refused, arguing that she’d continue to be poor even if her son had money.” </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Johnny Pitalúa</h4> 
<p>Then the kid Miguel said while jumping rope, “Four fights, oofff, Ol’ Johnny, fffoo, oofff, all wins.”</p> 
<p> And I, “Knockouts?”</p> 
<p> And the kid Miguel, “Three and one unanimous, ffffooo, decision, ffffoo.”</p> 
<p> And I, “Good, huh?”</p> 
<p> And the kid Miguel, “They got money, fffoo, you know, fffoo, the gym, fffoo, ffffoo, has equipment, fffoo, for everything, ooffff, to run, fffffoo, to climb stairs, oofffff, they measure, ffffoo, the heartrate, ooff, ooffff, and show stuff, oofff, on the computer.”</p> 
<p> And I, “Time. Rest for ten minutes and then ten sets of twenty-five sit-ups.”</p> 
<p> And the kid Miguel, “Oofff, fffoo, ffooo. Has Milton been back around here?”</p> 
<p> And I, “No, he hasn’t been back here in a year. He was in the San Pablo Mental Hospital.”</p> 
<p> And the kid Miguel, “Yeah, ooff, I saw when they put him in there, fffoo, fffoo, They showed him on TV, ffffoo, he had punched out some reporter.”</p> 
<p> And I, “Poor Milton. You know, at the start, cuz, I remember when he’d climb up in those buses to sell snacks and gum and when people asked him if he was Milton Olivella, he’d say, how in the world could you think that? Olivella lives in a big-ass house in Bocagrande and rides around in a big-ass car, and with all the money he’s got what would he be doing selling snacks on a bus?”</p> 
<p> And the kid Miguel, “Poor Milton, Ol’ Johnny.”</p> 
<p> Miguel kept looking at me like he wanted to tell me something but just couldn’t. He was still breathing hard. </p> 
<p> Then the kid Miguel said, “He was in my house, oofffffff.”</p> 
<p> And I, “What?”</p> 
<p> And the kid Miguel, “Milton, he was in my house, oofffffff.”</p> 
<p> And I, “Visiting?”</p> 
<p> And the kid Miguel, “No, Ol’ Johnny, ooffffff. It was like this, I went to a bar in Getseman’ with a few friends and some girls, no big deal, a few beers, grab some leg under the table. Oooooffffff, after a while I got up to go to the bathroom ‘cause I needed to take a leak. I get to the bathroom and when I opened the door I see Milton laid out on the floor in there, just smashed up. Oooffffff. I helped him stand up and I brought him home. My mama put some stuff on his cuts and gave him something to eat because he looked like he hadn’t eaten in a week. After that we put him in a bed and left him there. When we woke up the next morning Milton was gone and my mama was really mad because he had stolen the china from the dining room, you understand me, the only thing left from the old days when my old man had money and he bought my mama those things. Ooofffffffff. After that a cousin that worked in the bar told me that Milton paid twenty thousand pesos to a boxer friend of his to fight him in the street, right next to the entrance of the bar, and to let him win, so people would realize that Colombia has a real champion and all that stuff that Olivella would go to saying when he’s drunk. But my cousin said that Milton fooled around the whole fight, and then Milton hit his friend with a haymaker and his friend got mad and hit Milton back with a slobberknocker that nobody had ever been able to hit Milton with in the ring. People started to make fun of Milton, you ain’t shit, Olivella, you ain’t nothin’, even your shadow can beat you, and Milton started throwing punches at people left and right and fortunately didn’t hit anybody. After that my cousin said he cleared out and nobody knew where he had gone until I found him in the bathroom.”</p> 
<p> I didn’t know what to say. </p> 
<p> There was silence until I finally found the words, “OK, cuz, ten sets of twenty-five sit-ups.”</p> 
<p> And the kid Miguel, “It was a shame, Ol’ Johnny, a real shame.” </p> 
<p> And I, “A shame. You know something, cuz, it would have all been different if Milton would have gone to the hospital in Cuba.”</p> 
<p> And the kid Miguel, “Oh, no doubt, Ol’ Johnny, no doubt.”</p>

<p>Initially the dead prostitute had gotten the attention of the police and the local yellow press, but according to the curious few who left the bar and came back with information, the subject involved someone famous, and it was sure to hit the front page in all the national papers. It seemed that the prostitute had asked the client how he got a black eye and he responded by unleashing a torrent of punches on her while yelling at her not to think she was better than him. </p> 
<p>After all the excitement passed everybody waited for Milton to continue his fight story. Milton, satisfied to have regained everyone’s attention, looked up and walked to the table. He served himself a drink and looked around as if to ask for someone to remind him where he left off. </p> 
<p>“King came out looking to kill me, he knew he had me there, you know, bro, you know those things when you’re fighting, he threw me two straight punches and an uppercut, but he didn’t hit me and I got a little breathing room by walking backwards. I got to the ropes and I went by him on the side looking for time to recover. He had hit me hard in the face and everything was still moving. He worked me into the corner. I covered my face and threw a couple of useless punches to try to get out, but nothing, he knew what he was doing and he punished me in the ribs, the bad ones, brotha, and it hurt like a son of a bitch. Plus, those punches are bad, bro, they wear you down, they take the wind out of you, you can’t get any distance, you lose strength when they hit you like that. King knew that he had me, that it was his chance. I think he believed that the fight would be easier, that he was hurting and at that point he knew he could end it, that he could take that money home, you understand. But you know what, you know what I thought right then, I thought what’s fit for a dog to eat ain’t for a cat, because right then the bell rang.” </p> 
<p>“I need the handkerchief,” thought Olivella seated on the stool in his corner but he knew his seconds wouldn’t let him have it any more. Milton was tired and he felt that his strength was just about to leave him. He hadn’t trained like before in his best days, he didn’t have the patience for the workouts, didn’t have money for the right food and he was ashamed to ask for it from his friend Johnny Pitalúa. A week without meat is a long time for a boxer, he thought. “You know something?” says Milton, “The physical discipline will wear your ass out, you hear me? It’s not so much the being tired from when you’re done working out. It’s the going every day to the gym and not being able to do anything different, watch the fat, cut out sugar, a thousand sit-ups a day, four hours in the gym every day, you understand. It just winds up being boring. It’s like they’re stealing your life.” </p> 
<p> In the tenth round King came out determined to finish the fight or at least that’s what Milton noticed in his attitude. He attacked without respite. Milton slipped to his sides and clinched him while keeping his head back. Fortunately the cut on Milton’s eyebrow had stopped bleeding. Near the end of the round Milton took a right hook to the chin from King that had him seeing black for a second. He felt his knees buckle a little bit and his arms went to his sides involuntarily. He heard a gasp from the bullring’s crowd. When he recovered his senses he realized that he hadn’t fallen and he tucked his chin behind his shoulder and got his guard up.</p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Julián</h4> 
<p>I walk to the back where my desk is. Haeckermann is sitting in his office and he turns around to see who arrived. He turns back around without saying hello. If I still lived in Bocagrande, if Papa still had his collection of sports cars . . . Haeckermann would always say hello to me, it seems to me. I start to make all the arrangements for the delegation that’s coming for the national games. It’s a shitty job, although, I’ve had worse, it seems. I can do Haeckermann’s job better than he can. But he’s a Jew and I’m black and he has money and I don’t and he went to college and I didn’t. That’s the difference, it seems to me. They promised me I could go to school in the United States, the best, the most expensive. I had toys nobody else had, I had more clothes than any kid in Bocagrande, I had a chauffeur just for myself. Until one day the chauffer and car were gone, and we went from Bocagrande to an apartment, then they kicked us out of that and Mama started working as a maid during the days for all the rich women in Cartagena. They hired her so they could say that Milton Olivella’s wife was the woman sweeping their floors. Mama took me with her and she told me to work in the garden and cut the grass and later, the rich ladies would come and pay me and they’d say, Poor kid, they never thought about him, and they said between themselves that it was a tragedy every time somebody poor got rich, they didn’t know how to manage the money and it always turned out bad. And later Mama would tell me, Go to that lady whose garden you worked in and give her these fish and they would pay me and say, Look how he turned out. After that, Mama took me to a shop where they would pay me to wash cars and at night I would walk the streets in Getseman’ or Bazurto looking for Papa, and Mama at home wondering where he had gone, crying all night wondering if someone had done something to him, the people who believed that he still had money and could do him harm . . . There never was money for me to go to college. Papa preferred to give it way, share it with the prostitutes. After that, I wanted to fight, but Papa wouldn’t let me. It was fine for him, but he always told me it wasn’t for me. And it turns out it wasn’t good for me to go to the university or work for one of his rich friends like the son that he had with Roc’o that worked for the ex-President. But they’re different because when they realized that everything was going to fall, they left and they took what they could. That’s what we should have done, left him and gone far away. </p> 
<p> I go to Haeckermann’s desk. </p> 
<p> Everything’s ready for the delegations now, I say. </p> 
<p> OK, leave it there, says my boss without turning around. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Johnny Pitalúa</h4> 
<p>Then I heard someone come in the gym yelling, “Good afternoon, everybody, the champ has arrived!”</p> 
<p> It was Milton, with a busted lip and blood on his shirt. </p> 
<p> And then he pointed at Óscar “Kid Hands of yams” Manzur and hollered, “Let that right hand go . . . not like that, harder, harder, thaaaat’s it, listen to me brotha, if ya wanna become a champion.” </p> 
<p> And then he turned toward Efraim and hollered, “And this guy? This guy’s new, right, Bighead? Let’s go, kid.” </p> 
<p> And then he turned to the kid Miguel and yelled, “Bighead, how’s my student? He’s ready to fight for the title, I’m tellin’ you. Hey Migue’ I gotta talk to you later so we can fix a time where I can give you back that china. What happened was that I got up early and I liked those dishes and wanted to have some like them made for Ángela and since I didn’t have anybody to ask I thought I’d borrow them to use as a model and bring them back to you the same day, you know, but I got distracted with something else and I forgot to bring them back.” </p> 
<p> And the kid Miguel, “No problemo, Ol’ Milton, it’s all good.”</p> 
<p> And then Milton turned towards Blackie Espinosa and hollered, “Blackie Espinosa! The second most important black man in the country, because I’m the first.” </p> 
<p> And he went to laughing. </p> 
<p> Then he went and told Blackie Espinosa, “A round of cold drinks for everybody on my tab.” </p> 
<p> And then Milton looked at me and started walking to where I was. </p> 
<p> Then I said, “Milton, cuz, I must be seein’ things.” </p> 
<p> And Milton, “You know, Bighead, a man never forgets his friends.”</p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">* * *</h4> 
<p>Avski remembered a similar situation when Milton was falling apart in a fight and losing his strength. The story was repeated by Johnny Pitalúa and was recorded in Avski’s book. That was a day when Olivella was taking a beating like none that anyone who followed his fights had ever seen. Miguel López, a Mexican fighter without any special talent, was punishing Olivella with an array of punches he couldn’t figure out. One of the fight commentators remembered having said in the third round, “For those of you just joining this broadcast we want to clarify that the fighter boxing like Olivella is Miguel López from Mexico, and the one fighting like López is the Colombian champion Milton Olivella.” </p> 
<p>Pitalúa tells that Milton, during the break after the fourth round, asked his seconds to pass him the handkerchief. So one of them rubbed a white linen handkerchief against Milton’s nose and he snorted a cloud of cocaine that could have anesthetized a horse. “That was one of those things I didn’t agree with,” said Johnny Pitalúa to Joseph Avski. “Sure, cuz, Milton came out of the corner right after that like they just turned a wild animal loose and he gave López a beatin’ like you ain’t never seen. The referee had to stop the fight because López’ corner was hollerin’, ‘Stop it, he’s ‘bout to kill him!’ That same day they paid Milton with a kilo of cocaine and one of those cars Milton used to like.” </p> 
<p>According to former world champion Antonio Garc’a Madero from Mexico, that fight was the beginning of the end for Olivella. Milton’s body started to crave more drugs, and the discipline he had cultivated over years evaporated in a question of months. The cocaine that helped him win the fight against López started to have the opposite effect: destroying his fitness, deteriorating his reflexes, and diminishing his speed. But the physical change didn’t register in Milton’s mind. He stated publically that he was faster than ever, that his strength counted more now that it was backed up by experience. Dr. Lefebvre believes that timeframe marked the beginning of Milton’s mental problems. Olivella’s self-image, along with his understanding of the physical demands of his livelihood, unhitched themselves from reality and he fled farther and farther from the present to take refuge in the past. </p> 
<p>After he lost the championship Milton started to spend more money than he made. The drug cut several years off of his career and the fortune accumulated over years, the astronomical amount of money that seemed impossible to spend in ten lifetimes, started to disappear as if it were consumed by apocalyptic fire. One day the zeros in his bank account started to shrink until they disappeared. The next day the collection of luxury cars was auctioned. A week later the apartments bought two-by-two were sold four at a time. What were savings turned into debts. On another day the Olivella family was forcibly removed from their apartment in front of television cameras. Milton’s son, Julián, who had been going to the most expensive private school in Cartagena, was put in a public institution where he eventually received his high school diploma. </p> 
<p>It was about that time that the poet Raúl Gómez Jattín successfully underwent treatment for drug addiction at a hospital in Cuba and a group of reporters and officials at the ministry of culture and sports started a campaign to send Milton to the same treatment center. Milton was going to be sent to Cuba with the hope that his ego would be broken and that he would realize that his days of glory in the sports world had ended. In Cuba the people who saw him on the street would neither make fun of him nor stroke his ego. Another point in favor of sending him to Cuba was that he would be isolated from the pack of hyenas in Colombia who stood to gain from his descent into the vortex. In Cuba the merchants of misery wouldn’t be there to surround him hoping for a false step, whether it was to sell him drugs, sell their own books, or publish articles in the newspaper. The fundraising campaign to send Milton to treatment was capped off with a concert in Cartagena’s Apollo Park. The concert opened with El Combo de las Estrellas and headlined cumbia artist Rubén R’os. The program also included speeches by a line-up of candidates for mayor and senator, ex-presidents and even television actors with political aspirations who used the event as a platform for self-promotion. The event received extensive press coverage, but what was not well known was the fact that the amount of money raised was well short of what was required to send Milton to Cuba for treatment. </p> 
<p>A couple of years later, when the money to send Olivella to Cuba had been finally raised thanks to donors who didn’t stand to gain politically from the ex-champ, Milton decided to have one last party to celebrate. He stole most of the donations and gave himself over to a colossal orgy that lasted almost a month. When he finally showed up and said he was ready to go to Cuba he found his donors so enraged that the subject of Milton’s treatment was forgotten forever. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Julián</h4> 
<p>Nobody wants to hit the sheets with someone who’s been seen on TV being kicked out of his home by the police, it seems to me. There are the cops telling us we have to leave the house because it’s titled to a gringo named Green and Mama’s explaining to the police that this is the only apartment left of all the ones Papa bought when he was world champion and that the property is titled to Milton Olivella and not to some gringo Green and then the TV cameras came to cover the scandal that was again shaming the ex-world champion boxer Milton Olivella and his family but Papa isn’t aware that he’s no longer world champion or at least he’s not conscious of it all the time and sometimes believes that he’s still living in that era. When he came to eat lunch with us everything seemed normal and he’d talk about the sea swells and how they were damaging the tourism in Cartagena and Mama seemed happy that Papa was well and because he didn’t come home violent and throwing things on the floor or breaking things and he’s sitting down for lunch and says that the sea swells were affecting the tourism and the economic outlook of the whole department and the investments destined to support sports and especially boxing in the city could be reduced and the President’s visit to the port and the close relationship the President has with Cartagena and all that he was prepared to do for the city and for San Basilio de Palenque and that sounded strange to us and Mama looked up with a shadow of worry and she kept looking at Papa and Papa kept talking and saying that it’s not that he would want anyone to thank him but if the President cared about Cartagena and Palenque it was because the world champion Milton Olivella had interceded with the ruler of the country and said that he had to go meet with the President because he was going to put electricity in Palenque and suddenly he asked Mama where the keys to the Porsche were and Mama with tears running down her cheeks tells him he had sold the Porsche and Papa says he doesn’t have time for games because the President is waiting for him and he needs the keys to the Porsche, the car, and Mama’s looking at him crying and he stands up and looks through his pants pockets and I yell at him that he doesn’t have a Porsche or anything or shit, that he had spent it all and then he says you watch how you talk to me because I’m Milton Olivella, World Junior Welterweight Champion and I tell him he’s not champion of shit anymore and it seems like he doesn’t hear me and he says out loud to himself Now I know where I left the keys to the Porsche and he leaves the house. And now it’s we who have to leave the house because the policeman explains to Mama, in front of the reporter and in front of the camera, that Milton Olivella signed the papers that say that the apartment is now the property of William Green and that the corresponding payment has been made and then the reporter asks the cop how the amount was paid and who is William Green and the cop responds that it seems that the amount was paid with cocaine but until it’s proven they couldn’t act on it and that the name is probably an alias for a gringo narco-trafficker but for now they had not been able to prove anything and Mama doesn’t stop crying and tries to talk but can’t for the crying and the policeman tells us again that we have to leave immediately or he’s got to take us into custody for home invasion and Mama says between sobs that this is our house and we haven’t invaded the home of anyone and the cop says it’s not our house anymore and that Papa already sold it and we can only take a few items of clothing and Mama throws herself on the floor crying and I try to pick her up and she doesn’t get up and just cries and says crying Where are we going to live . . . Where are we going to live . . . Where are we going to live . . . Where are we going to live . . . and the cop and the reporter don’t care that we’re left in the street without a dime and homeless and nobody cares what happens to us because now we don’t have money and you’re only worth what you have. </p> 
<p> Is it around here? the taxi driver asks. </p> 
<p> I look at the place and realize that yes, it’s around here where I’ll find Papa, it seems to me. </p> 
<p> Yes, let me off here, I say. I pay him and I get out. </p> 
<p> A thing like that can’t be forgiven, it seems to me. Nobody’s going to want to hit the sheets with a person who gets thrown out of his house on television. Nobody decent would want his wife and son to be homeless. Before, all the women wanted to hit the sheets with me but that was before, it seems to me. </p> 
<p> I call Lucero from a pay phone. Never any answer. I walk to the cafeteria where I’m going to meet Papa. There are a couple of streets right after Estanco de Tabaco Street, it seems to me. Lucero and I met in the days when nobody wanted to go out with me because when your father is world champion and has money all the women want to hit the sheets with you, but if your father blew all the money and you’re dying of hunger in the street then no woman wants to hit the sheets with you and if your job only earns you enough to take care of your mother and you don’t have your own car and the apartment where you live is rented because they kicked you out of where you live while everybody watched it on television and you’re black and your boss is a Jew and you’re not as good looking as Saint Jude, then nobody’s going to want to have anything to do with you, it seems to me. Lucero used to say that she didn’t care about that but now she doesn’t answer the phone and it’s because she’s already found someone with money, it seems to me. </p> 
<p> I get to the place, but Papa hasn’t arrived yet, so I light a cigarette. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Johnny Pitalúa</h4> 
<p>So I asked him again, “What happened to you?”</p> 
<p> And Milton, “Nothing, brotha, like I told you, an accident.”</p> 
<p> And I said, “Don’t bullshit me, Milton, you were in a fight.”</p> 
<p> And Milton, “Keep it down; I said it was an accident.”</p> 
<p> And I, “However you like. Where are you coming from?”</p> 
<p> And Milton, “From meeting with Julián. You know, bro, I gave that pension the government gives me to Julián and Ángela. It’s that, you know . . . I’m going to start doing things right, you understand.” </p> 
<p> And I, “And you fought with Julián?”</p> 
<p> And Milton, “Knock it off, Ol’ Johnny, I just told you to keep it down.” </p> 
<p> We sat there for a while without saying anything. With the blinds of my office closed it seemed like the gym was empty. </p> 
<p> Until Milton says, “Did I tell you that a reporter wants to talk to me tonight?”</p> 
<p> And I, “No, you haven’t told me anything.”</p> 
<p> And Milton, “They tell me that the guy writes books and wants to write one about me. So you see, in Colombia they still remember a champion.”</p> 
<p> And I, “Congratulations.”</p> 
<p> And we go back to waiting in silence. I go to looking at a photograph hanging on the wall where Milton and I are dressed up like the Fania All Stars singers in the good times. </p> 
<p> And Milton, “You know something, Bighead, I don’t believe Julián’s ever going to forgive me for that thing about the apartment.”</p> 
<p> And I, “Nobody admired you and idolized you as much as Julián. I remember when he went out those nights to look for you because you didn’t come home and Ángela was worried, and he went into all those places that weren’t for a child to go into. And when the people in the street got into it with you because you were drunk the boy defended you like a little cornered lion.”</p> 
<p> And Milton, “I know, Ol’ Johnny, I know, and that’s why it hurts me.” </p> 
<p> His voice broke a little; he cleared his throat and kept talking; “Now he hates me, Ol’ Johnny.” </p> 
<p> We went back to sitting in silence for a while. The photo was taken in Los Angeles. Milton always asked me to go with him, like another corner man. Sometimes we sparred; sometimes I just went with him. Milton looked at the photo, too. </p> 
<p> And Milton, “You know something, Bighead, see how life is. You never won anything and now you’re better than me.” </p> 
<p>And after a second he kept talking, “Take care of the kid Miguel. Not so he’ll be a champ, but so that he doesn’t turn into shit afterwards.”</p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">* * *</h4> 
<p>“It all happened in one second,” explained Milton, raising his left arm to cover his jaw and setting his feet in the form of a T, “Everything went black but I didn’t go down. When I reacted I hid my chin behind my shoulder and got my guard up. Ol’ King came at me again. He wasn’t letting me rest, bro. I tried to take advantage, you understand, let him throw punches and wear himself out, study his attack to know where I could do him some damage.” Milton was moving from side to side slipping King’s invisible punches in the bar. He feinted toward the right and bumped against a chair with his thigh, and in that moment saw an opening in King’s defense and launched an upper cut that exploded against King’s jaw. King went backwards and went sprawling against the ropes. Milton immediately pressed the attack trying not to let King fall. He knew that if King went down he’d have time to recover from the punch and come back to attack, but if he was able to punish him enough before he hit the ground he was sure that he’d not be able to get up before the referee counted to ten and he’d go home with the money for his treatment in Cuba. Milton worked King into a corner and corralled him there. A right hook reopened the cut that King had on his eyebrow. Milton sent a combination to his ribs and finished with an uppercut that, in its trajectory, banged into an empty beer bottle and sent it exploding on the floor. King covered up but he couldn’t respond. Milton attacked with every offensive combination he had. The younger fighter seemed to be going down but Milton didn’t let him fall and kept up the punishment. The crowd shouted louder with each blow. In the middle of the audience’s enthusiasm Milton Olivella could make out the sound of the bell that announced the end of the assault, but he couldn’t believe it. He cursed himself for not having let him fall. A young man like King could recover in the sixty seconds between rounds while he had nothing left for another attack. </p> 
<p> As he waited for the next round to begin he thought about the little laminated image of Saint Jude that his wife carried everywhere. Milton clung to Ángela Iguarán’s prayers. At the start of the eleventh round Olivella attacked King with the certainty that his wife’s prayers would give him the victory. It was his chance to get his life back. Both fighters gave and took punishment giving no quarter. Milton could feel his punches getting weaker. He didn’t know if the same thing was happening to King’s because he didn’t feel them. The pain in his ribs was killing him and he knew that he was going to go down at any minute, not by any specific punch, but because his body had nothing left, nevertheless he decided to hold nothing in reserve and kept hitting with everything he had left. </p> 
<p> King did the same. He punched without bothering to keep his guard up or looking for an opening. Boom, he punched, boom, he took, boom, he punched, boom he took, boom, he punched, boom, he stuck, without rest. The crowd shouted in approval of the bravery of the fighters and heaved up phrases of encouragement. </p> 
<p> Milton threw a right hook not just with the strength of his arm but with the force of his entire body. The punch felled King who appeared to be unconscious and Olivella himself almost fell to the canvas from sheer exhaustion. The referee started the count. Milton doubted that he could keep himself upright for the ten seconds that King would be on the canvas. The referee got to six in the count before King started to barely react. At the count of eight he seemed like he was getting to his feet but he staggered. Milton saw the stumble as confirmation of his victory, raised his hands and saluted the crowd. Nonetheless, when the count got to ten King was standing, the referee held his gloves, and signaled to continue the fight. </p> 
<p> As soon as the combat renewed the two fighters clinched. Once the referee separated them they couldn’t manage much of a fight. Both were trying to recover, but Milton felt like his strength was sapped even though he hadn’t done any work. King, on the other hand, seemed to have recovered and appeared to be the stronger fighter. Olivella stopped a pair of King’s jabs but felt like it took everything he had just to keep his guard up. King seemed to understand the situation and he attacked. Milton slipped toward the ropes and from there to a corner. King followed him to press the fight. Milton kept avoiding until King corralled him in a corner. Milton tried to defend himself with a jab that bounced off King’s defenses. King counterattacked with a hook to the side that further damaged Olivella’s ribs. Milton arched his body in pain and saw an uppercut coming toward his face. He tried to raise his left arm to protect his chin but he wasn’t sure if his arm was reacting or not. He felt like he was coming back from Cuba, healed and seeing his wife and son waiting for him in the airport. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">Julián</h4> 
<p>Papa arrived late, just like I expected. </p> 
<p> How are you, I say. </p> 
<p> Fine, son, recovered, responded Papa, fighting the disease. Thanks to God, son, and Mama’s prayers, it’s been some months since I used, since I went into the hospital. Take care of your Mama, son, take care of her, she’s a saint who doesn’t deserve the life that I give her, but you know what, son, your Mama’s faith is going to save me, I know it. Life is like a title fight and even though I’m behind on points, thanks to your Mama’s faith the fight is not lost. </p> 
<p> I know it’s a lie; that he used just a little while ago. I can tell. Papa is the biggest liar on earth. The waiter comes. Papa orders a cold soda and I do as well. He says I’m not having beer because I don’t want anything with alcohol. He says that right there’s where you fall into the grip of addiction all over again and you’ve got to keep your guard up all the time. They bring us the drinks and we sit in silence for a while. </p> 
<p> I have the papers here, I say. </p> 
<p> Explain it to me again, son, says Papa. I do this for you and for your Mama, you know because I love you a lot and I want to make up for all the mistakes I’ve made, to start over, you understand, you know how it is, son, you know. </p> 
<p> I take out a pack of cigarettes and I offer him one. </p> 
<p> A cigarette, yes, son, says Papa taking one, it calms me down. I’ll tell you something, it’s easier not to use if I smoke, a screwed up thing because it’s like choosing the lesser of two evils. That’s how life is: screwed up. </p> 
<p> I take out another cigarette and the lighter. I offer him a light and then I light my own. I snap the lighter closed and take out the papers. </p> 
<p> These are the papers to authorize Mama to cash the government pension, I say. </p> 
<p> Let me see that stuff, he says, exhaling smoke. </p> 
<p> I pass him the papers and wait for him to look at them. He looks them all over and hands them back to me. </p> 
<p> It seems like it’s all right, says Papa. But explain it to me anyway so I understand it all. In life one has to be sure of the decisions that one takes. I’ve been sorry many times and I don’t want it to happen to me again, you know. </p> 
<p> It authorizes Mama to cash the pension checks that the government is giving you, I say. </p> 
<p> What do I have to do then, asks Papa. </p> 
<p> Nothing, just sign, I say. </p> 
<p> Then pass me the papers, says Papa. </p> 
<p> I pass him the papers and he looks at them again like he’s checking to see everything is in order. Meanwhile he takes out his pen and writes MILTON OLIVELLA in capital letters with the handwriting of a seven-year-old. </p> 
<p> There you go, says Papa, and he hands me back the papers. </p> 
<p> I see he doesn’t have his wedding ring on and I figure he exchanged it for drugs. </p> 
<p> Where’s your wedding ring, I ask. </p> 
<p> I’ve got it in a safe place, says Papa. </p> 
<p> Where, where’s the safe place. </p> 
<p> In a friend’s house, says Papa. </p> 
<p> What friend, I ask. </p> 
<p> Just a friend, says Papa. </p> 
<p> You traded it for dope, didn’t you, I ask. </p> 
<p> Papa doesn’t answer. </p> 
<p> You traded it for dope, I say. </p> 
<p> I’ve got it in a safe place, says Papa. </p> 
<p> Where, I ask. </p> 
<p>At a friend’s house, says Papa. </p> 
<p>What’s this friend’s name, I ask.</p> 
<p>You don’t know him, says Papa. </p> 
<p>It doesn’t matter, tell me his name, I say. </p> 
<p>Papa sits there without saying anything. </p> 
<p>You traded it for dope, I say. </p> 
<p>I haven’t traded anything, says Papa. </p> 
<p>Then where is the ring, I ask. </p> 
<p>I already told you, says Papa. </p> 
<p>In whose house, I ask. </p> 
<p>I already told you, you don’t know him, says Papa. </p> 
<p>Doesn’t matter, tell me who he is, I say. </p> 
<p>A friend from TV, he’s keeping it at his house in Bogotá, says Papa. </p> 
<p>Well, then, I know him if he works in TV, I say. </p> 
<p>No, you don’t know him, says Papa. </p> 
<p>Tell me the name, I say.</p> 
<p>He’s not an actor, says Papa.</p> 
<p>So what does he do in TV, I ask. </p> 
<p>Something else, says Papa.</p> 
<p>What, I ask. </p> 
<p>He writes telenovelas, says Papa. </p> 
<p>How did you give it to him if you haven’t been to Bogotá since way before you went into the hospital, I say. </p> 
<p>Papa doesn’t answer. </p> 
<p>Where’s the ring, I ask. </p> 
<p>A friend is keeping it at his house in Bogotá.</p> 
<p>How’s Ángela, asks Papa. </p> 
<p>Mama’s fine, I say, where’s the ring, I ask. </p> 
<p>You tell her I said hello, says Papa, tell her I miss her very much. </p> 
<p>Where’s the ring, I say. </p> 
<p>Tell her that soon I’ll be home to stay, says Papa, I just need to wrap up a few pending issues, you know how it is. If I can get this thing ready we can make a little money to start fresh, to get the life back that we used to have before. Tell her that we’re going to start a new life, you know, following the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ. </p> 
<p>Where’s the ring, I ask. </p> 
<p>Anyway, I’m going to call her on the phone before so she knows that at any minute I could be coming home for good, says Papa. </p> 
<p>I stand up and I grab Papa by his shirt collar.</p> 
<p>Where is the goddamn ring, I shout.</p> 
<p>Papa pushes me and gets free of me. I go up to him and I grab him again by the shirt collar. </p> 
<p>Where, I say shaking Papa back and forth, is, the, goddamn, ring, I say.</p> 
<p>Don’t act like you’re better than me, says Papa and he pushes me, you need to respect me because you’re talking to a world champion, says Papa. </p> 
<p>You ain’t world champion of shit, I shout and I try to grab him again by the shirt collar. Papa doesn’t let me grab him and he pushes me. I hate to be pushed. I throw a punch and it explodes on his bottom lip. I can feel my knuckles smash his lip against his teeth. Papa doesn’t stop to see the busted lip I’ve just given him and he comes at me like a demon. He hits me in the eye and I go down to the ground. He tries to jump on me but I let loose a kick in his stomach that makes him fall down, too. </p> 
<p>Not even a phone call on my birthday, you son of a bitch, I shout. </p> 
<p>I get up and when I try to move toward him to try to punch him again I feel myself grabbed from behind: it’s the owner of the place. I look and a bunch of people have come out of nowhere and grabbed Papa. They keep us from continuing the fight that we want to keep fighting. I want to hit him I want to hit him.</p>

<p>After his father got them to let him back into the gym, Olivella’s discipline was impeccable, Turk Samir had told Avski. Milton started to avoid anything unhealthy. When the fighters at the gym went out for a drink he’d order mineral water or juice. Every morning, even when he wasn’t preparing for a fight, he’d run twelve miles to start his day. In Chambacú, the poor neighborhood in Cartagena where he moved with his mother from Palenque, he had acquired the habit of smoking marijuana two or three times a week. He had continued smoking in moderation when he wasn’t preparing for a fight, but quit completely when he started to train seriously. He avoided staying out late at any cost and watched his diet and his temperament as part of his psychological training before a fight. </p> 
<p>The Mexican former champion Antonio Garc’a Madero says that Milton was always a gentleman out of the ring. In spite of the fact that he hadn’t finished school he never seemed out of place in any situation. He got along in any social circle and was capable of engaging in any conversation. But of course, at first, remembers Turk Samir, his good manners were an inconvenience in the ring. He’d punish his rivals until they couldn’t effectively fight back, but at the moment where he needed to finish them off he’d relax and let them recover. It was as if he considered it unsporting to hit a guy who was already beat up. Many times his opponents would end up recovering to the point where they could nearly come back and defeat him. Other times the crowd, seeing Olivella’s lack of killer instinct, would lose their patience and start to boo him. Garc’a Madero claims that if he hadn’t been able to get over that defect he would have never become world champion. </p> 
<p> It was a problem Turk Samir didn’t know how to manage. One night Milton’s agent, the businessman Ram—n Saade, frustrated at Olivella’s passivity against a nearly-defeated opponent, unleashed a string of insults against his fighter. It was a reaction that you would have never seen from Turk Samir, who maintained his calm demeanor until the day he died and if he ever yelled it was, “Get your left up you’re unprotected.” Milton’s reaction to Saade’s tongue-lashing was immediate: he threw a devastating straight right that sent his opponent to the clinic for two days. Saade immediately understood the situation. At Olivella’s next fight he stood behind Turk Samir and when Milton started to back off of a hurt opponent Saade let loose a shout that could even be heard on television: </p> 
<p> “Nigger son of a bitch you ain’t worth shit!”</p> 
<p> Milton connected with a left that was so savage the other fighter immediately went down. When the referee restarted the fight after the downed fighter had been counted and regained his feet, Milton again failed to close the distance and finish him off. </p> 
<p> Saade renewed the verbal attack on Olivella, “You must be a faggot because you ain’t no fighter.” </p> 
<p> At that moment Olivella uncorked a combination that prompted the referee to run to stop the fight because the Olivella’s barrage of punches wouldn’t let his rival go down. Once the referee intervened Milton’s opponent fell to the canvas like a rag doll. </p> 
<p> After that night Saade continued to locate himself in his sponsored fighter’s corner, not to give technical advice, but to launch insults at opportune moments. On the night of October 28, 1972, when Olivella was being beaten in the second, and surely the last fight of his contention for the world title, Saade shouted the phrase that changed the history of the World Junior Welterweight class. </p> 
<p> “You wanna get paid, Olivella? Then you better turn them fuckin’ hands loose and start punching, you nigger son of a bitch, or I’ll send you back to eat shit in Palenque.” </p> 
<p> Olivella threw a combination so fast that the victim told the press that he never saw it. It was so powerful that it laid him out on the surface of the Nuevo Panama complex for much longer than the ten seconds that it took the referee Hernández to call the fight. Fifteen thousand people stood in silence, disconcerted by how the bout had ended. If you count the team that came with Olivella, the Colombians in the coliseum who saw him crowned world champion numbered less than fifteen people. The most important moment in the history of Colombian sports wasn’t seen by anybody because the television stations decided not to cover the fight, believing that boxing was a sport for blacks and people on the coast that didn’t interest people in the capital. While Milton Olivella was showing a pitiful and defeated nation how to win, the country stood in ignorance with its back turned. In those days the budget didn’t allow for Milton to bring either of his women or a single one of his friends. Olivella’s reign started in abandon and loneliness. </p> 
<p> At the door of the coliseum Saade was waiting for him in a van. The first thing that Olivella saw when he stepped inside was a blonde that would be the first white woman to share his bed. Before leaving the place Milton asked if he could invite his defeated opponent to the party. Much later, in a brothel bedroom near the Panama City port, after Saade told the women to get out, Olivella received the first important sum of money of his career in front of his adversary. </p>

<p>Then Efraim says hitting the sandbag while I hold it: “One, two, oofff, oofff. One, two, oofff, oofff. One, two, oofff, oofff. So what was it like, Ol’ Johnny? One, two, oofff, oofff.”</p>

<p>And I, “There came a time when nobody could touch Milton and he knew it.”</p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.”</p> 
<p>And I, “And that’s not good, cuz, that’s overconfidence.”</p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.”</p> 
<p>And I, “All the Welterweight fighters who could have beaten him were either retired or dead.”</p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.”</p> 
<p>And I, “He knew it, cuz, and he had this absurd confidence and there I was wanting to fight, wanting to make a name for myself.”</p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.”</p> 
<p>And I, “Before the fights he’d be taking a nap just at the time when any fighter in the world would be about to have a nervous breakdown, he’d be sleeping.”</p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.”</p> 
<p>And I, “While he was sleeping I was training, hoping that one day I’d get my shot, too.” </p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.” </p> 
<p>And I, “I got better. A whole lot better. I eventually had a decent record that never included fifteen defeats in a row before turning pro.”</p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.” </p> 
<p>And I, “But it was never enough.”</p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.” </p> 
<p>And I, “I never got on the list to contend for the title. I never got to Milton’s level, not even with those guys he fought against, I wasn’t even on their level.”</p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.” </p> 
<p>And I, “And after I saw him go down it was like I went down myself.”</p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.” </p> 
<p><i>But it was better that we go down together than for me to have to go on putting up with the fire that burned me inside. </i></p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.” </p> 
<p><i>It’s like watching some other guy screw your woman right in front of you and you can’t do nothing, just love her and hate her.</i></p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.” </p> 
<p><i>And then I started bringing cocaine to his workouts and I would tell him I did it out of friendship; and I explained to him that I didn’t want him running around with bad people to try to get it and I told him to snort some, to try to quit it gradually, that he should snort a little less every day, that he was everything I wanted to be and that’s why I didn’t want him to destroy himself because it was like he was destroying me.</i> </p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.”</p> 
<p><i>But when I would get home I would imagine him snorting more and more and I’d break out in an ear-to-ear smile. Milton was like a statue and I was blowing him up into a thousand pieces and I was blowing up with him.</i></p> 
<p>And Efraim: “One, two, oofff, oofff.”</p> 
<p><i>And after, when he lost the title and he cried on my shoulder and I cried too, but from joy, because I had finally put out the fire after nine years, the constant burning. When he lost the title I started smoking and I stopped training. I was free.</i></p>

<p>I’m going to Media Luna street. I’m going to Media Luna street. I’m going to Media Luna street. I’m going to Media Luna street. Lucero doesn’t answer the telephone. Nobody wants to hit the sheets with a person who doesn’t have money, not even Lucero. I smoke and smoke. I didn’t want to hit her. I did want to hit Papa because he yelled I’m the world champion no shit and what he is was champ for a little while no shit I’m the most valuable black man in this country no shit but he wasn’t world champion anymore and we were rich and the women wanted to hit the sheets with me and Mama was praying and Papa was telling her to shut up and Papa was all bloody all over because he had been fighting in the bar and they had broken a bottle on his head and Mama was praying and asking him what happened and Papa didn’t answer until a neighbor told me that they had broken a bottle on his head and Mama was praying and Papa was telling her to shut up and that the world champion was ordering her and Mama was praying and Papa started to yell at her why are you praying if it was because she thought she was better than the champion and Mama wasn’t saying anything but kept praying and Papa was telling her not to think she was better than him and Mama praying and Papa was yelling at her You’re not better than me You’re not better than me You hear me You’re not better than me and Mama doesn’t stop praying Blessed spirits of purgatory Most Holy Virgin Saint Judas Tadeo Sacred Heart of Jesus and Papa You’re not better than me You understand You’re not better than me You’re not better than the champion and Mama kept on praying and Papa yelled at her to shut up and Mama praying and Papa Shut up I tell you I want you to shut up and Mama doesn’t quit praying Blessed spirits of purgatory Saint Judas Tadeo Blessed blood of the Sacred Heart and Papa yells at her to stop praying that she’s not better than him and Mama Merciful Jesus free my husband from this spirit that possesses him and Papa Shut up I’m telling you for the last time and Mama, Lord enter into the body of my husband and give him your infinite peace Make him feel . . . and Mama fell and her nose was bleeding but she didn’t say anything and kept praying and crying and I wanted to hit him and I hit him and I said you’re not world champion anymore, you’re not shit and he yelled at me to respect the champion and Mama yelled at me not to hit him that he was my father and I had to respect him and that she was his wife and that’s why he could hit her but I didn’t want to respect him and we grabbed and hit each other and Mama yelled Blessed spirits of purgatory Most Holy Virgin Saint Jude Tadeo Sacred Heart of Jesus don’t let them kill each other don’t let them hit each other and since that day if Papa comes home violent I know it’s the last way to deal with him, with punches, like dogs, like animals. But I don’t want to hit Lucero, lucero no lucero no lucero no lucero no. </p> 
<p> I call her but she doesn’t answer. She asked me to never do those things but now it’s not my fault, she doesn’t answer. While I call Lucero again I look at Papa. I hide so he doesn’t see me. I smoke. He went into the bar where he was going to meet with the reporter: the shirt with blood all over it, the swollen lip. He looks like a dead man. He’s dead anyway, it seems to me. </p> 
<p> I go into the place. I’d rather not drink anything, I just want to smoke. I look at one of the women and I choose one. I go up with her to hit the sheets. I don’t want to hit her I don’t want to hit her I don’t want to hit her. I smoke. </p> 
<pagebr /><h4 class="chapter">* * *</h4>
<p>“It was luck that the punch didn’t connect,” thought Olivella. He wasn’t feeling any pain and the stinging in his ribs had subsided. The shouts of the crowd could be heard like the deafening roar of the rotors of a helicopter. “It was my best time,” thought Olivella and he set himself adrift in remembrance.</p> 
<p> There was a time when opponents went down like bugs sprayed with insecticide. The last few minutes before a fight Olivella would be more worried about having to interrupt the conversation about politics with Andres Pastrana, the son of the President, than about the fists of his rival. </p> 
<p> In those days Milton had asked President Misael Pastrana to put electricity in San Basilio de Palenque, his home town, and the president had responded with a non-committal answer about the strategic development plan that the country was implementing and that it would be inconvenient to modify the program. Nevertheless he concluded that the program was viable and that he’d take it into consideration. The days passed and Palenque continued in the governmental neglect that had been in force since 1901, the year that General Jaramillo’s troops, in the name of President José Manuel Marroqu’n, burned the town as punishment for having provided three hens and a pot of soup to General Robles and his battalion in rebellion against the government. </p> 
<p> Except for another city-wide fire the inhabitants of Palenque didn’t expect anything from the central government. The one from whom they did expect something was Milton, who was venerated almost like a saint. Milton’s answer to the presidential inaction was public: </p> 
<p> “If you’re not going to put electricity in my town do me the courtesy of telling it to my face,” he said in front of the television cameras.</p> 
<p>For many, this was the sign that Palenque would never have electricity. However important Milton was, this was an open challenge to the President and on those terms it couldn’t result in anything else but disapproval of the proposal. Two days later an armed forces helicopter landed at Palenque. The inhabitants came out of their houses and gathered in the packed dirt plaza to see the novelty of the machine. At the same time, out of the rotorwash stepped down Milton Olivella and President Misael Pastrana. Milton was dressed in a pinstriped suit, a white turtleneck sweater, and platform shoes. The President, who looked like Olivella’s advisor for the occasion, was dressed in turquoise trousers and a sky blue shirt. Behind them came a bevy of reporters in charge of showing the public that the President’s promises are never in vain. The President gave a little speech in which he talked about the installation of electricity as the first of many projects planned for Palenque. The people of Palenque didn’t pay attention to the President’s speech because they were all trying to touch Milton Olivella to see with their own hands if he was real.</p> 
 
<p>* * *</p> 
 
<p>Olivella was the first champion in a country of losers. Up until the moment when Milton won the world title Colombia still celebrated the 4 – 4 tie with the Soviet Union in the World Cup of 1962 as a win. The rest, the real victories, came after: Miguel “Happy” Lora and his thirty-seven wins in forty fights. Lucho Herrera, Fabio Parra, Atlético Nacional, Once Caldas, and the Copa América - all after the great Milton Olivella; before him, nothing, the desert. </p> 
<p> The cult of Olivella turned him into an omnipresent being, an obligatory theme at every table, the only national reference along with coffee. The myth grew larger than the man, who, for his part, disappeared a little more every day in a cloud of crack smoke. The country accustomed to losing fell in love with the Colombian who learned to win. But Milton only knew how to lose in life what he won in the ring. When he ran out of opponents to inoculate him Milton fell victim to his own poison, like a scorpion in a ring of fire. </p> 
<p> Olivella was sitting in his corner being attended to by his seconds. When he woke up someone was wringing out a sponge with cold water on his head and they were fanning him with a towel. He realized that his gloves were off and his mouthpiece was out. He looked up to see King was being carried on the shoulders of his seconds. From the shouting of the crowd he could only make out the insults hurled at him. He got up, left the ring, and headed for the locker room. </p> 
<p> “Let’s go,” he said to his seconds, “I don’t want them to see me crying like that Argentine Marturet.”</p> 
<p> Having finished telling the story of the fight Olivella excused himself and said that he had to leave because he had another commitment. He asked Avski to hurry on the book because he wanted it in time to celebrate the anniversary of his world title and he said goodbye with a hug. The patrons at the nearby tables stood and applauded, sending him off with fighting poses and fists in the air. A local prostitute put her hand to her mouth and blew him a kiss. “I love you, champ!” shouted the woman. </p> 
<p> Olivella gave her a sly wink and raised his hands as if he were stepping down from the ring as the victor. Joseph Avski saw him exit the door of the bar into the blackness of a long night, where Kalb al-Akrab shined majestically. He also went into another time; an age where the kingdom of his fists was untouchable. </p>
