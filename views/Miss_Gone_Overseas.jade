    .bookBlurb
      p.just In the sparse, lyrical style of a classic pillow book, Miss Gone-overseas chronicles a wartime life that doesnâ€™t focus on guns, bombs or military depredations, but on the pedestrian life of a lower-class Japanese woman as she reflects on the turmoil around her. Set on a lush tropical island during the later part of World War II, the book begins and ends with separations that are also beginnings.
